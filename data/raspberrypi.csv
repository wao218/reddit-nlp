But right at the beginning I've run into a snag, while I can connect to the pi using SSH the moment I have to enter the password I get repeatedly denied. First, yes I have tried reinstalling Raspbian and carefully entering the password into the settlings (more then once), checked to ensure I enabled SSH on the installer, and deleted the old SSH settings on my laptop to attempt it from the top. Still it rejects the password over and over and I can't figure out why."

But, I couldn't even achieve running the ***u-boot*** properly. The board launches up without any problem and starts running the ***u-boot***. The ***u-boot*** then tries to read the contents of the SD card but it cannot. This is how the terminal screen looks like:

raspberry_pi,Appwrite introduces Realtime API to its Self Hosted Firebase Alternative,"&amp;#x200B;

[Appwrite Dashboard](https://i.redd.it/kfrdajjfz8l71.gif)

I'm an Appwrite maintainer and we're happy to share that Appwrite 0.10 has just been released and adds support for one of our most requested features.

Appwrite now comes with **platform wide Realtime API** that allows you to listen to any server side event. This includes events like user registration, file uploads, document updates, serverless function executions and much more!

Appwrite also has [support for ARM devices](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/discussions/1041) and you can run Appwrite even on **your Raspberry Pi.**

Here's a sneak peak of 0.10

* A brand new **Realtime Server**
* Real time support in our **Web, Flutter and Android SDKs**
* New **user update endpoints** for admins to manage users
* Authentication with **Magic URLs**
* Even **Faster Cloud Function** executions
* We've **terminated some bugs**
* Not to mention, we're **one step closer** to becoming a complete Firebase Alternative

If you haven't heard already, [Appwrite](http://appwrite.io/) is an open-source end-to-end BaaS that helps you build your Web, Flutter and Android apps much faster with a focus on simplicity, developer experience, privacy and security that you can self-host with a [single Docker command](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation#unix).

We'd love to get your feedback as we move on to v1.0 of Appwrite in the coming weeks. Community feedback has been one of the major driving forces for where the project is today.

You can checkout our Github repo at: [https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite)"

raspberry_pi,8GB Pi4 + Argon One M.2 + 1TB SSD = Crash on boot?,"I've got a new Pi4 + Argon One M.2 case + 1TB Western Digital SSD that I'm setting-up as a home server. The plan is to set it up so it boots off the SSD. This will be the 3rd Pi4 I've set to boot from SSD, but the first in this case. I'm running the latest 64-bit Raspberry PI OS and no overclocking attempts.

Twice now, when I unplug everything (monitor, mouse, keyboard, power, WiFi) and move it to a new location, it starts the boot-up sequence and then powers off. The new location is headless and 10BaseT, but I doubt that's the issue, because returning it to the original location, the problem remains until I redo the whole set-up. The boot screen flashes past too fast to read, but it looks like it's ~~dieing after something video related~~ a kernel panic/error.

Any similar experiences? Any troubleshooting tips?

Attempts/research done so far:

1. Put everything back to the last know working state and the same error was experienced. The same power supply was used in both locations.
2. Reinstalled the SD card (first time only) and device boots fine.
3. Googled to see if anybody was having the same trouble, with this case or any Pi4.
4. Googled to see if this was a known issue with Ubuntu 21.04 for arm64 in general.
5. Googled to see if this was a known issue with Ubuntu 21.04  in general.
6. Tried several times to see what the last message was before the screen went blank
7. Googled ways to pause the screen during boot-up
8. Tried 'Screen Lock' several times w/ no success
9. Tried 'Pause/Break' several times w/ no success
10. Tried 'Ctrl-S' several times w/ no success
11. Posted my first message to r/raspberrypi
12. Added an EDIT: with OS &amp; overclocking information
13. Saw that the first post had a comment and started to reply
14. Noticed that my first post was deleted due to a lack of research
15. Stared at several more start-up and became moderately sure the last text is something about a kernel panic/error
16. Remembered I experienced something similar with the amd64 running Bodhi (also Ubuntu-based) laptop after a 'full-update'
17. Realized that the one commonality between the two occurrences were full shutdown and power disconnect
18. Scratched my head (literally) and pondered about why the laptop had an issue after a warm start and the Pi4 only showed a problem after a full power down
19. Google to see if there were any reports of 'full-upgrade' causing problems with 21.04-based distros
20. Decided WTF and posted at r/Ubuntu regarding 'full-upgrade' in 21.04 messing-up the boot partition/kernel images
21. Got a cup of coffee
22. Scratched my head (literally) and ruminated about re-posting over here with updated information
23. Copypasta'ed my original post, added the strikeout style, two small edits and this pedantic, semi-assholely list"
raspberry_pi,8GB Pi4 &amp; Argon One M.2 Crash on Boot-up?,"I've got a new Pi4 + Argon One M.2 case + 1TB Western Digital SSD that I'm setting-up as a home server. The plan is to set it up so it boots off the SSD. This will be the 3rd Pi4 I've set to boot from SSD, but the first in this case.

Twice now, when I unplug everything (monitor, mouse, keyboard, power, WiFi) and move it to a new location, it starts the boot-up sequence and then powers off.  The new location is headless and 10BaseT, but I doubt that's the issue, because returning it to the original location, the problem remains until I redo the whole set-up. The boot screen flashes past too fast to read, but it looks like it's dieing after something video related.

Any similar experiences? Any troubleshooting tips?"

raspberry_pi,Teaching Python to beginners with microcontrollers,"Hi all,

I am not sure if this is the right forum for this! But I’ve been lurking for the past three on this community and as an electronics hobbyist I am really inspired and impressed at what this community has been able to build. 

In high school I fell in love with building various electronic projects with microcontrollers. It was one of the most rewarding feelings to see my programs come to life and I immediately became hooked. Once I got to college and took a couple of coding courses, I began to wonder why coding and logic wasn’t being taught to beginners with microcontrollers instead of on an IDE, since the applications were so much more exciting and less abstract than building a calculator or printing a rectangle in the terminal.

In an attempt to teach coding with real-world applications and make programming as exciting as possible for beginners, I started a company called JuiceMind ([juicemind.com](https://www.juicemind.com)). Our first product, the Python Essentials kit, teaches the fundamentals of Python in 8-10 hours with a microcontroller and various electronics! The kit contains a few real-world projects that are meant to engage students and show them what is possible with coding after writing only a couple of lines of code. Additionally, all of our tutorials are cloud-based and interactive to make learning as easy as possible.

If anyone has any friends who want to get into learning coding and electronics, anyone who wants to explore MicroPython, or anyone that has a close family member who is applying to colleges that wants to add a Python as a skill as well as various projects on their application, our company would love your support.

Finally, thank you to this community for constantly providing inspiring content and pushing people like me to create different projects. I have a ton of idols on this subreddit page :)

I tried everything i could possibly think of: try multiple cables(all of which work flawlessly with phones), try different ports, try restarting the pc, uninstalling the device, updating multpile drivers but every time its the same story. 
The only glimmer of hope is that i can see the mass storage drive on my pi3b+ and have thrown in the blinker program and the pc seems to be powering it since the led is blinking.

At this point i'm stuck, and don't know what to do/try next. If any of you guys could suggest solutions i would be very grateful."
raspberry_pi,2021 Aug 30 Stickied 𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊 thread - Boot problems? Display problems? Networking problems? Need ideas? Get help with these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"###[Welcome to the r/raspberry_pi Helpdesk and FAQ!](http://f2z.net/RPi-Helpdesk-FAQ.png)

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/paapod/2021_aug_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
2. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing/freezing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: What model of Raspberry Pi do I need so I can watch YouTube in a browser?  
A: [No model of Raspberry Pi is capable of watching YouTube smoothly through a web browser, you need to use VLC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kocdez/which_if_any_raspberry_pi_is_powerful_enough_to/)
11. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
12. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things? Can a Raspberry Pi run Pi-hole and something else at the same time?  
A: **YES**. Pi-hole uses almost no resources. You can run Pi-hole at the same time on a Pi running Minecraft which is one of the biggest resource hogs. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
13. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ov5gj6/cheap_power_backup_for_pi_using_power_bank_module/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/).
14. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
15. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
16. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
17. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
20. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
21. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oo46ih/i_mapped_a_few_trrs_cables_to_the_rca_connectors/).
22. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: A Raspberry Pi is a full computer running Linux and doesn't use special stripped down embedded microcontroller versions of standard Linux software. Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux. Also see question #1.
24. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it with an Arduino. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi Pico?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Arduino, a Pico can be used with the Arduino IDE.
25. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,"Is Pi-Hole the equivalent of a ""hosts"" file in a windows/linux/MAC machine?","Hello everyone, so I'm learning how to use Pi-Hole to block adds and work as a Local DNS server so anyone inside my LAN can access my Django Apps using Apache2.

I just learned that every machine (linux/windows/mac) has a ""hosts"" file.

When a request is made to a domain name ""[awesomewebsite.com](https://awesomewebsite.com)"", the browser FIRST goes and looks into that ""hosts"" file to see if there is a domain-name/ip match. If the browser finds NO match, then it goes OUTSIDE the local network and ""asks"" the DNS servers (I beleive theres like 3 types of DNS servers) to find a match.

&amp;#x200B;

Browser(request)-------&gt;""hosts"" file------&gt;External DNS

&amp;#x200B;

If I install Pi-Hole in my raspberry pi 3B+, does that mean, everytime I make a request to a domain name ""[awesomewebsite.com](https://awesomewebsite.com)"", the browser will FIRST look into the ""hosts"" file....if no match is found it THEN GOES to the Pi-Hole (DNS Server) to look for a match, and if NO match is found it will FINALLY look outside my LAN and into the internet and ask the external DNS servers?

&amp;#x200B;

Browser(request)-------&gt;""hosts"" file------&gt;Pi-Hole DNS------&gt;External DNS

(this is for finding out the domain name ip)

&amp;#x200B;

OR....

...the browser when loading a website, it skips at FIRST the Pi-Hole DNS server (since I believe is a list of add domain names) and goes to ""hosts"" file...and then to External DNS to find a match. When the response comes back and loads the website on the browser, is it at THIS point that adds are requested for and now the browser ASKS the Pi-Hole DNS server for an add domain name ""[boringadd.com](https://boringadd.com)"" but tells the browser ""Bro, that domain doesnt exist"" cause the add domain ""[boringadd.com](https://boringadd.com)"" registered in the Pi-Hole has an ip of [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) which is the ""loopback"" so it never goes OUTSIDE the LAN to find a match?

&amp;#x200B;

Browser awesomewebsite.com-----&gt;Browser looks for adds ip match in Pi-Hole DNS-----&gt;gets nothing

&amp;#x200B;

Is that how it works?

Im kind confuse if a website is loaded WITH the adds, or it loads FIRST the website and then the browser goes out again asking DNS servers (Pi-hole or external DNS) for a matching ip address for the adds domain names requested after loading the website?"

I would also like to send Korg type ""midi clock"" out from the Pi's audio output (as opposed to the GPIO as mentioned-&gt;) [here on github.](https://github.com/jpenca/mirg) It seems I need to manually connect my usb midi devices, could this be achieved automatically on startup..

1. Automatic usb-midi detection &amp; connection for the korg pulse.
2. Signal routed thru 3.5mm audio output.

raspberry_pi,Virtual Hosts not working from another PC inside my LAN?,"Hello everyone, so I have a raspberry pi so I could learn linux and how to configure a webserver atleast the basics to host my Django apps. Right now I will not be working with Django, just basic html file to learn about virtual hosts.

When I try to access my 2 sites (2 virtual hosts in raspberry pi) from my laptop, the sites can connect.

Here is what I did:

**1. Created a directory structure for each site:**

/var/www/soccer/index.html

/var/www/volleyball/index.html

**2. Created a "".conf"" file for each site inside ""sites-available"":**

*SOCCER SITE (soccer.conf):*

&lt;VirtualHost [192.168.1.15:80](https://192.168.1.15:80/)\&gt;

ServerName [soccersite.com](https://soccerkev.com/)

ServerAlias [www.soccersite.com](https://www.soccerkev.com/)

ServerAdmin [soccersite@msn.com](mailto:socceradmin@msn.com)

DocumentRoot /var/www/soccer

ErrorLog ${APACHE\_LOG\_DIR}/error.log

CustomLog ${APACHE\_LOG\_DIR}/access.log combined

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;  


*VOLLEYBALL SITE (volleyball.conf):*

&lt;VirtualHost [192.168.1.15:80](https://192.168.1.15:80/)\&gt;

ServerName [volleyballsite.com](https://volleyballkev.com/)

ServerAlias [www.volleyballsite.com](https://www.volleyballkev.com/)

ServerAdmin [volleyballsite@msn.com](mailto:volleyb@msn.com)

DocumentRoot /var/www/volleyball

ErrorLog ${APACHE\_LOG\_DIR}/error.log

CustomLog ${APACHE\_LOG\_DIR}/access.log combined

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;  


**3. I edited the /etc/hosts file and added the following:**

[192.168.1.15](https://192.168.1.15/) soccersite.com

[192.168.1.15](https://192.168.1.15/) [volleyballsite.com](https://volleyballsite.com/)

**4. I enabled the sites:**

sudo a2ensite soccer.conf

sudo a2ensite volleyball.conf

**5. Reloaded the Apache2 server:**

sudo systemctl reload apache2

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**MY RESULTS:**

Now, when I enter ""[soccersite.com](https://soccersite.com/)"" and ""[volleyballsite.com](https://volleyball.com/)"" from my raspberry pi's web browser, I can access the sites OK.

If I enter [192.168.1.15](https://192.168.1.15/) in the browser, it gives me the ""soccer"" site, since it's the first virtual host created, and NOT the ""[volleyballsite.com](https://volleyballsite.com/)"" since that's the 2nd in the list.

BUT, when I try to view the websites ([soccersite.com](https://soccersite.com/) and [volleyballsite.com](https://volleyballsite.com/)) from my personal laptop connected to the SAME LAN network, it just loads a random website that has nothing to do with my websites I created.

IT ONLY LOADS the ""soccer"" site when I enter in the browser:

[192.168.1.15](https://192.168.1.15/)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**MY QUESTIONS:**

A. The ""hosts"" file, whats inside, how can it be explained easily, I'm kinda confused about it's content and how it works. Not sure if that's causing my problems. I've that in order to view the sites from OUTSIDE your LAN and from anywhere in teh world, I need to register DNS. Since my goal is just host multiple website inside my LAN from any device inside that same LAN, I dont need to register DNS etc.

B. How can I view those 2 virtual host sites from other devices under the same LAN network by entering the Domain names only?

It works from all devices in my LAN but ONLY if I enter the ip [192.168.1.15](https://192.168.1.15/), and it only gives me the ""soccer"" site. If I where to have 5 virtua hosts, they wouldnt connect with domain names.

What am I missing?

Thanks for any help and guidance.

Good day to all!"

I installed PiOS and created the wpa_supplicant.conf to see if it's the device or the SD but that's working fine.

I checked my routers DHCP hosts and the pi has the same ip. It didnt changed.

When I try to ssh from my windows 10 machine:

ssh [pi@192.168.1.13](mailto:pi@192.168.1.13)it gives me the followinf message:

""ssh: connect to host [192.168.1.13](https://192.168.1.13) port 22: Connection timed out"".

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was ok, even while doing the Apache tutorial I logged out of ssh or vnc just to check all was fine and connected fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Why all the sudden I cant connect via ssh or vnc?

&amp;#x200B;

All I did was create 2 virtual hosts with apache, enabled the sites and added to /etc/hosts the following:

&amp;#x200B;

[192.168.1.13](https://192.168.1.13)[mysite.com](https://mysite.com)

[192.168.1.13](https://192.168.1.13)[mysite2.com](https://mysite2.com)

&amp;#x200B;

I performed a ""systemctl status apache2"" last night before shuting down the pi and it sais ""running""..ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Im stuck!"
raspberry_pi,Can't connect to RPi4 through iPad Pro USB-C when booting from SSD,"I followed [this](https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/) guide for getting my RPi4 to be recognized by my iPad Pro as an ethernet connection in an effort to create a mobile development setup. I was then able to use SSH and VNC to control the RPi directly on my iPad through the IP address that was set up during the configuration process.

After seeing how well that worked, I went ahead and purchased an [Argon ONE m.2](https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-m-2-case-for-raspberry-pi-4.html) case so that I could boot from an SSD instead of the comparatively slower SD card I had been using. However, this is where my problems began.

After configuring the RPi to boot from the SSD and getting Raspberry Pi OS reinstalled successfully, I'm unable to get my iPad to recognize the RPi as an ethernet connection as it did before.

Does the configuration process I'm using need to be modified, or is this just something that's not possible to do?"

* USB 3.0 read/write speed?
* Pi's own read/write speed limitations?
* Ethernet?

**2**: What is the speed limit going to be?

raspberry_pi,It appears that the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 audio interface works with the raspberry pi 4,"The Scarlett 2i2 doesn't require any driver installation on Mac (ARM processor).  It's just a plug and play audio interface.  Since Raspberry Pi OS can install on Mac hardware it got me thinking...  I figured if it's the same chip architecture, the audio interface might just work, so I plugged it in to my rpi4 and it totally did work.

I'm not sure what the power draw is from the audio interface but the audio output is what you would expect from a Mac or PC.  The only problem is there isn't enough power to really drive an XLR mic.  Haven't been able to test any of the line ins for recording guitar but it might work.

Not sure if this is really ""safe"", and I can't find any spec sheets that give info on the power draw of the audio interface, so do if you're gonna do this, it's at your own risk."

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
2. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: What model of Raspberry Pi do I need so I can watch YouTube in a browser?  
A: [No model of Raspberry Pi is capable of watching YouTube smoothly through a web browser, you need to use VLC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kocdez/which_if_any_raspberry_pi_is_powerful_enough_to/)
11. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
12. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things? Can a Raspberry Pi run Pi-hole and something else at the same time?  
A: **YES**. Pi-hole uses almost no resources. You can run Pi-hole at the same time on a Pi running Minecraft which is one of the biggest resource hogs. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
13. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ov5gj6/cheap_power_backup_for_pi_using_power_bank_module/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/).
14. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
15. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
16. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
17. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
20. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
21. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oo46ih/i_mapped_a_few_trrs_cables_to_the_rca_connectors/).
22. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: A Raspberry Pi is a full computer running Linux and doesn't use special stripped down embedded microcontroller versions of standard Linux software. Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux. Also see question #1.
24. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it with an Arduino. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi Pico?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Arduino, a Pico can be used with the Arduino IDE.
25. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

After I had to shelf my  project for a long time, I have finally found the time to get at  soldering all the parts together. As I plugged it in for the first time,  the red light of the GearBest Powerboost turned on, the screen and  raspberry pi zero however did not. To check what could possibly be  wrong, I plugged the power source into the rapsberry pi directly and it  turned on, along with the screen - the tinkerBOY controller however  didn't work tough. I resoldered all the connections between the  tinkerBOY controller and the pi, to sort out the issue  but it still, doesn't seem to work.

The *only* thing I've found so far is using udev to specify the names of things, but I have been unable to get this working.

Here's two snippets from `dmesg` for two of my tty devices:

    [    7.266665] usb 1-1.1.3: New USB device found, idVendor=2c99, idProduct=000c, bcdDevice= 2.00
    [    7.266689] usb 1-1.1.3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3

    [    7.505051] usb 1-1.1.1.1: Product: u-blox 7 - GPS/GNSS Receiver

And here's what I put in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules`:

    SUBSYSTEM==""tty"", ATTRS{idVendor}==""2c99"", ATTRS{idProduct}==""000c"", ATTRS{serial}==""PrusaMiniPlus"", SYMLINK+=""prusa-mini-plus""
    SUBSYSTEM==""tty"", ATTRS{idVendor}==""1546"", ATTRS{idProduct}==""01a7"", ATTRS{serial}==""GPSReceiver"", SYMLINK+=""gps-receiver""

Then I ran this:

    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; sudo udevadm trigger

Unplugged &amp; plugged-back-in the devices and... nothing. Still `/dev/ttyACM0`.

So how do I make this work? I just need a reliable path to devices that's not dependent on the order in which the computer *decided* to create the dev/tty devices..."

raspberry_pi,Possible for grid-like GPS in something like a parking lot?,"Hi!  


I've never used a Raspberry Pi before, but I was curious if the following is possible using one/some of them!  


Basically, I work at a location where we keep track of many vehicles. We have an OBD plug in GPS system that tracks everything, but the problem I'm facing currently is that the GPS is very general. As soon as the vehicle pulls into the yard (or within a certain range of any other vehicle really), it just lumps their markers together in one spot. That's fine for on the road tracking, however one thing that I need to do at the end of each night is go out and map out the parking lot (they are all parked in a grid, I just have to write down where everything is).  


I'm assuming that any GPS system will do a similar thing to what our current one does, but what I was thinking was maybe there's a way to put something (such as a RPi in this case) in each vehicle, and then be able to see the locations of each of them via something like an app, or even just a console terminal printout. Maybe ""see"" each other in terms of sense a proximity and direction of another device within a certain distance or something.  


I'm obviously still in the brainstorming phase of this, and I'm willing to hear alternate solutions if what I'm saying is not achievable!  


I have a decent amount of programming experience with various things, so this part isn't an issue for me to figure out with some time, it's really just the hardware available/what a possible solution could look like.

raspberry_pi,Pi won't connect via ethernet after router reboot.,"I have a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B that is running raspbian and it is currently being used as a homebridge and pi hole. It was set up yesterday on a fresh sd card and every time I reboot the router it is wired to, it doesn't connect to the network anymore and all the LEDs on the ethernet jack on the Pi are off. The only way it reconnects to the network is if I unplug the ethernet cable at the router side and plug it back in.

So far I tried setting it up with a static ip address as well as reserving a DCHP address for its MAC address on the router (192.168.1.2), as well as adding dtparam=eee=off on the config.txt but the issue persists.

I don't think it's hardware related because I was using this very same Pi with the same cable and the same router (running the same firmware) up until a week ago as a dedicated pihole server and there were no issues like the ethernet not ""coming alive"" after the router reboots.

Any ideas?"

I installed and set up my system with no issues at all, but when I tried to manually build some stuff I got the following error by GCC:

    internal compiler error: Illegal instruction

I did some tests and I found out that I couldn't compile a program as simple as

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    int main()
    {
    	float x = 3.14f;
    	printf(""Pi is %f\n"", x);
    }

The ""float"" keyword itself seems to cause the compiler error. The very same program is built with no issues on my other Raspberry Pi 4B (which runs the regular 32 bit ARM OS). The Pi CPU definitely has an FPU, and many of the packages I installed on my aarch64 system most likely use it. Is this normal?

Im using a Core Micro 64GB Micro SD which came in a bundle with the Pi zero. I've never heard of this brand so it probably isnt great but the bundle had many good reviews so I dont think it would be the SD? 

What should I test? This is really frustrating. 

Should I be doing benchmarks? I did a benchmark in the terminal for read speed and it said 15MB/s, but I dont know what to do with that info because in other threads people are saying that its more about random read times or something like that.

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/p1bmtq/2021_aug_9_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
2. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: What model of Raspberry Pi do I need so I can watch YouTube in a browser?  
A: [No model of Raspberry Pi is capable of watching YouTube smoothly through a web browser, you need to use VLC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kocdez/which_if_any_raspberry_pi_is_powerful_enough_to/)
11. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
12. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things? Can a Raspberry Pi run Pi-hole and something else at the same time?  
A: **YES**. Pi-hole uses almost no resources. You can run Pi-hole at the same time on a Pi running Minecraft which is one of the biggest resource hogs. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
13. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ov5gj6/cheap_power_backup_for_pi_using_power_bank_module/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/).
14. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
15. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
16. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
17. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
20. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
21. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oo46ih/i_mapped_a_few_trrs_cables_to_the_rca_connectors/).
22. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: A Raspberry Pi is a full computer running Linux and doesn't use special stripped down embedded microcontroller versions of standard Linux software. Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux. Also see question #1.
24. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it with an Arduino. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi Pico?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Arduino, a Pico can be used with the Arduino IDE.
25. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

The parts I’m trying to get to work together are the Pi 4 (4Gb), the official PoE+ (5v 4a) HAT and the official 7” touchscreen.

My biggest problem right now is that the display ribbon cable is in the way of the bottom of the HAT. There are no spacers at present as I’m just measuring up but I can’t see how this would work.

The fan screws on the official Pi HAT were also too long to stay clear of the camera connector. I have resolved that by turning them around.

raspberry_pi,Painfully slow Ethernet speed on R4,"Yes I'm aware there are tons of other similar posts, but I've tried the steps outlined there and still don't understand why I'm facing this issue.

I use my Raspberry Pi 4 mostly as a NAS. Lately, I've had buffering issues when streaming, including some crappy 200MB movie files.

I've moved to a new SD card, Sandisk ExtremePro microSD A1 (microSDHC, 32GB) as SD card tests failed recently. Now they pass… but the issue persists.

RPI is connected via a CAT6 cable directly to a Gigabit port of the main router/modem. Home internet connection is 150 down / 80 up

I've also tested disk speeds for both the SD card and the USB3 disk connected to the RPI, speeds are of at least 40 MB/sec.

I am planning to build a simple waiting/queue management system for my own needs. The issue I have is that I wasn't able to find a small, raspberry pi-compatible, printer.

Printer requirements:
- Has to be relatively small so that the printer will fit in a custom made casing alongside the Raspberry Pi 3/4.
- Has to be relatively easy to add paper (once the paper is consumed).
- Has to be easy to replace color (Although preferably the colors should not be changed at all, if this is technically possible...).
- It shall use small paper size for printing. Something like a few centimeters for width and height.

Any links or recommendations are much welcomed.

So i'm trying to make a home NAS. I have 4 1tb HDDs running in RAID 0 using mdadm. 1 of the drives is connected directly to the usb3 port and the other 3 are connected via a usb 3 hub to the other usb3 port and have external power. I have 2 issues i need help figuring out:

1: for some reason, mdadm would not finish building the raid 5 array i was originally planning on. It would fail like 0.2% into the build cause for some reason all the drives went missing from the drive tree (still had power). And after reboot they would show up again for a while or disappear altogheter and not show up.

2: i switched over to RAID 0 which has been working well for the most part. But whenever i use fstab to make it automatically mount, it wont work. When following tutorioals that say to set the last number (pass) to 0 aka on boot, disks will not show up nor will the raid array. When set to after boot, sometimes they will, sometimes they wont.

Any help is appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

We're in the middle of opening a restaurant, and there are 4 TVs ready to be used as a menu-display. They're LG smart TVs, but I cannot seem to be able to force them to

* start playing videos from USB after being powered on
* not pop up the seek bar after the videos restart

so I'm thinking of setting up a few Raspberry Pi's to be used as the video source.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never used such hardware before, therefore I'm a complete noob. What I gathered so far is that the Pi 4 Model B has two HDMI outputs - I'm hoping there's a solution where I only need to purchase two of those, then I can loop one video on one output, and loop a different one on the other output.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking your help, because I'm not sure if this is the right approach (hardware-wise), and even if it is, I don't know what software to use on the Pi's. I found several video looping solutions, but none mention the ability to play different videos on different outputs.

raspberry_pi,RPI 4 WiFi can only be pinged when ethernet is connected.,"I have an RPi 4 on my network, it is accessible by SSH and via a web browser as it is running apache. I am having a problem though discovering the device via Ping any device when it is directly connected to the network via WiFi, but if I connect an ethernet cable then I can ping the device at the WiFi IP Address. I have a bash script that runs every 5 minutes that checks to see if there is a known SSID in range and if there is checks to see if the RPi is already connected to a known network and if so it falls through. If there isn't a known SSID in range then it turns on a hotspot and acts like a DHCP server. 

The issue I need to resolve is why does the RPi not respond to ping on its WiFi IP Address when it is on WiFi only, but does respond to Ping on the WiFi IP Address when a network cable is connected? I have written an Android app that searches for networked devices and if I cannot reliably find the device on the network it makes everything moot.

Below is every bit of information I can think to provide about the configuration/setup. If there is more I can provide I would be happy to find it and share. Thank you in advance. On a side note I have scoured the forums, stackoverflow, Googled any and all things I can possibly think of to try, but to no avail.

none of them worked and if I try to reboot the pi it locks up at boot.

raspberry_pi,Noob boot: Network Connection Error: connection timed out,"I can't get into my Pi via ssh (or by remote connection but I haven't gotten in via ssh to set that up yet).  When I use Putty with the IP address that I got from Advanced IP Scanner, it sits there for a minute and then tells me that there is a Network Connection Error: connection timed out.

I've included my steps so far below:

1. I got a 16 GB SD card, formatted it, then flashed the image of Raspian to it.
2. Then I connected the SD card to my RPi and turned on my Pi for a minute, and then turned my Pi off and took the SD card out.
3. Then I put the SD card back into my computer, and added a blank text file named ""ssh""
4. I then put the SD card into my RPi, turned my RPi on, and put in the ethernet cable, attaching my RPi to my laptop (which is the where the USB that I am using to power the RPi is also connected to).
5. Turned on sharing on my computer, then got the IPv4 address from the ethernet connection.
6. Then used IP Scanner to find my RPi's IP address.  I searched the above IPv4 address but from XXX.XXX.XXX.0 - XXX.XXX.XXX.254.  Honestly I don't know where 254 comes from but that's what the guide I'm following did.  There's a ton of connections that pop up, but only one is named something about raspberry pi, so I used that one.
7. From there, I opened Putty and put in the new IP address that I believe is from the RPi but it says the network connection times out.  I am stuck here and don't know what else I should / could be trying.  Just looking online I found a ton of different ways to boot a Pi but haven't had success with any of them. 

Other misc things that could be relevant:

1. I actually got this to work a year or two ago, and got in via Putty, and also got remote connection to work.  This was a while ago so I don't really remember what I did, but I had to stop because I was busy with other things and am just now picking it back up.  So I know it worked at one point.
2. I have a extension thing (?) that goes into my USBC port on my laptop and it has 3 USB ports and an ethernet port, so I've been connecting via that (my laptop doesn't have an ethernet port).  This is the same way I would've done it when it worked before, but I don't know if cable arrangement or having other things plugged in at the same time might be messing with the ports or which port it thinks it is connecting to.

I'm still learning but I have a project will require multiple temp/humidity sensors. I have 2 Adafruit MS8607 PHT boards. I connect one up using the i2c bus and get my readings just fine, I connect the other and it shows up on a different address based on [i2cdetect -y 1]. 

In my code for one sensor I have a line like [sensor=MS8607(i2c)] that gets the data from the sensor. Currently it errors out on that line when I have the second sensor connected.
 How do I configure this to get data from each sensor, I am assuming I would use the address for each and name them different names (sensor1, sensor2). I'm using circuitpython.
 
I read up on how to create a second bus but was hoping I didn't have to do that.

Any help is appreciated, if this isn't the right sub for this type of question let me know and I will go to the appropriate place."

raspberry_pi,"solar+battery sky camera, Reduce power consumption","I'm working on an all-sky camera that's solar powered.  Basic idea is that a pi with a 12MP camera and fish-eye lens takes pictures of the sky at regular intervals and pushes them to the web.  

It seems like power consumption of a pi-4 is about 1-1.5Ah per hour (eg, I can get about 1hr of use from a 1200mAh battery, but not more).  The sun isn't up at night, so this obviously won't do.

1. The pi is running a single python program+wifi+camera.  How big of an impact on power consumption is shutting down non-essential services (eg xwindows, hdmi ports etc)?
2. The biggest lipoly battery I've found is a 10000mAh (10Ah) unit from Adafruit.  I suppose I could go the deep-cycle route with a dedicated charge controller?  Other ideas?  
3. Does a Pi zero have drastically lower power consumption?"

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
2. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: What model of Raspberry Pi do I need so I can watch YouTube in a browser?  
A: [No model of Raspberry Pi is capable of watching YouTube smoothly through a web browser, you need to use VLC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kocdez/which_if_any_raspberry_pi_is_powerful_enough_to/)
11. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
12. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things? Can a Raspberry Pi run Pi-hole and something else at the same time?  
A: **YES**. Pi-hole uses almost no resources. You can run Pi-hole at the same time on a Pi running Minecraft which is one of the biggest resource hogs. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
13. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ov5gj6/cheap_power_backup_for_pi_using_power_bank_module/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/).
14. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
15. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
16. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
17. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
20. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
21. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oo46ih/i_mapped_a_few_trrs_cables_to_the_rca_connectors/).
22. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: A Raspberry Pi is a full computer running Linux and doesn't use special stripped down embedded microcontroller versions of standard Linux software. Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux. Also see question #1.
24. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it with an Arduino. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi Pico?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Arduino, a Pico can be used with the Arduino IDE.
25. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

Did i miss something? Why does it give me this error when i try to run it specifically with box86?

Reason for running it like this: I installed box64 too (since some apps require 64 bit support), and if i leave it to find an interpreter it defaults to box86.

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi's HDMI as ARC to control volume,"Hi, I'm trying to control the volume in my Logitech Z906 speaker system connected to my TV (Sony with Android TV) using my TV's remote control.

What I've achieved now is that I'm able to turn on and off my Z906 and change input in it. This is thanks to Sony Bravia TV integration in Home Assistant and LIRC package installed in my Raspberry Pi (with IR transmitter) located near my TV. The problem is that the TV's state is not refreshing frequent enough to control volume using this approach.

Because of this I was thinking to config my Raspberry Pi so the TV will see my Raspberry as an amplifier/soundbar (or any other sound system), so I will be able to retrieve information about volume change through HDMI CEC. I've already installed cec-client and receive information from TV about some keys that are pressed on my remote, however not about volume and second of all, input from HDMI where Raspberry is connected needs to be active so this is no-go for me.

PS. There is no need to decode audio or pass it on through raspberry because TV is connected directly to Z906 using optical cable, I just want to get information about volume change, so I can control the speakers."

raspberry_pi,Possible for an IPad connected to a Raspberry Pi to access Angular apps running on the Pi?,"Hello,

I am currently planning to use a pi to run an angular app and I was thinking of having an Ipad act as a touchscreen display to run the app.

I see that it is possible for the Ipad to connect to Raspberry pi via SSH from online tutorials, however I have not seen any videos/information around what I am trying to do with the Pi.

If anyone has experience working with an Ipad and raspberry pi, are all ports open for the Ipad and Pi to communicate in-between? For instance, if I connect the Ipad and raspberry pi via USB-C, can I just use safari on the Ipad and make a local connection to (ip of the Pi):(port of the angular app).

I don't know anyone IRL that has an Ipad model with the USB-C connection so this is why I have turned to asking online to see if anyone has done something similar. 

All help is appreciated,

Thanks!"

I've been told to try booting without an SD card to see if the onboard splash screen shows up.  But I don't know if the Pi Zero has one.  I've googled and seen the Pi 4 version, but nothing for Pi Zero.

Could someone confirm if the Pi Zero shows a screen without an SD card.  Screenshot would be nice!

raspberry_pi,Raspi as a server: SSD or mechanical hard drive?,"Hi, guys. I'm launching a Raspberry Pi server project.

The server should provide the following purposes:

* Crypto mining
* email and webpage hosting
* Cloud hosting
* Application server (i.e. Matrix)

I know that the SSD has the advantages of being faster and longer lasting. The mechanical drive has the advantage of more possible disk space. Usually I'd prefer the mechanical drive so that I won't run into a disk space limit soon. But I don't know if there are specific disadvantages when it comes to Raspberry Pi.

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
2. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: What model of Raspberry Pi do I need so I can watch YouTube in a browser?  
A: [No model of Raspberry Pi is capable of watching YouTube smoothly through a web browser, you need to use VLC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kocdez/which_if_any_raspberry_pi_is_powerful_enough_to/)
11. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
12. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things? Can a Raspberry Pi run Pi-hole and something else at the same time?  
A: **YES**. Pi-hole uses almost no resources. You can run Pi-hole at the same time on a Pi running Minecraft which is one of the biggest resource hogs. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
13. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ov5gj6/cheap_power_backup_for_pi_using_power_bank_module/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/).
14. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).

16. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
17. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
20. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
21. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oo46ih/i_mapped_a_few_trrs_cables_to_the_rca_connectors/).
22. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: A Raspberry Pi is a full computer running Linux and doesn't use special stripped down embedded microcontroller versions of standard Linux software. Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux. Also see question #1.
24. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it with an Arduino. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi Pico?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Arduino, a Pico can be used with the Arduino IDE.
25. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

raspberry_pi,(First project) Trouble delivering data to WS2811 LEDs from Pi,"Hey there, this is my first electronics/RPi project, please bear with me.

I've been following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJupt2LIjp4) as closely as possible. I ordered [these lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AG923GI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), [these jumper wires](https://chicagodist.com/products/jumper-wires-connected-6-m-f-20-pack), this [power adapter](https://chicagodist.com/products/female-dc-power-adapter-2-1mm-jack-to-screw-terminal-block), and a 4B.

I recently got a raspberry pi 4 model B (and using Raspberry pi OS) and I wanted to connect my computer to it using SSH. I installed no-ip to my raspberry pi with these guides (same main steps, but the 2nd link has a bit more info):

[https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-ip-duc-onto-raspberry-pi/](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/install-ip-duc-onto-raspberry-pi/)

I've been able to successfully SSH using my no-ip hostname, assuming I manually set my raspberry pi's wlan0 IP address to the no-ip hostname in [no-ip.com](https://no-ip.com). The main problem is when no-ip restarts or when my raspberry pi boots up again or reboots, the ip address connected to the no-ip hostname is changed to some random ip and I have to manually set it again (which, I think, isn't the point of having a dynamic DNS service). How do I keep it so the no-ip hostname is always connected to my raspberry pi's wlan0 IP address when my raspberry pi is on? Or does my raspberry pi need to constantly be turned on for no-ip to work?"

So my solution was to see if once the files are synced from my phone to pi, can I somehow autocopy that folder to another location on the pi.
This way if any changes are made to the synced folder on the pi it doesn't get deleted from the copied folder.

This is confusing to explain and confusong to write lol,

If there's a better way of doing this wirelessly please let me know,

There's so many Options on the Internet and I can't find any good Display, so I thought I would ask the guys that are more into that than me."

raspberry_pi,"OverlayFS and read-only also turns external mounted drive ""read-only""","Background
I have recently discovered and experimenting with `OverlayFS` setting in `raspi-config` on RPi3 with `openmediavault`. I am trying `OverlayFS` because system on sdcard is way too fragile. So far, this feature is able to prevent sdcard from failing.

Issue
However, the external HDD mounted seems to be ""read-only"" as well. I found that it is still writable with `sudo` or when I am in `sudo su`. This is rather inconvenient since this system is configured as media hub and it doesn't make sense to use super user access for everything.

All the directory and files seem to be in `drwxr-xr-x` and `root` as owner (I didn't pay attention if it is the same case when OverlayFS is activated)

I am still learning the nature of `OverlayFS` + `read-only` setting and I have the following questions:

1. How to use `OverlayFS` + `read-only` with writable external drive? 

I tried adding `rw` in `/etc/fstab` and `mount -a` to remount. But it is still unwritable to others. `sudo chmod +w` executes but no effect is taken. `sudo chown pi:pi` results in `Operation not permitted`

2. If that's not possible, any other trick to protect sdcard while writable to external drive.

I have done a quick search on this sub but no answer is found. Any suggestion is appreciated ~"

My current setup includes a  raspberry pi 4,  PITFT resistive touch screen, and a MAX 98357 I2S Mono Amp. I have run the scripts to install the necessary stuff for the amp. And not only did it mess up my alsamixer settings to the point i can't even access alsamixer at all, but it says that there aren't any audio devices detected at all. I've tried several fixes already, and the pi seems to still have alsa-utils installed, it's just not... working for some reason.   
On top of all that, I can't even get the amp to work! The only sounds I've been able to get out of it is random LOUD static, and I can't even control when it happens. It just happens. And \*yes\*, it's wired up correctly. I've tried attaching Gain to GND and not attaching and same issue, just loud intermittent static.  
It doesn't seem like too many people post their projects using these amps, so if anyone is out there that can help me troubleshoot, I'd be extremely grateful, because I'm at a complete loss."

raspberry_pi,How to reduce swappiness for better performance,"I have not seen this recommended here and just wanted to highlight it as it made my RPi4 perform much better. I was experiencing brief lock-ups when using memory heavy applications like Chrome and this completely resolved them. It will probably help any model but I highly recommend it if you have 2GB or more of RAM.

If you're not familiar, Linux uses a concept called Swap. It's similar to the Windows paging file. The kernel will move programs from RAM into a designated place on your disk. It's a useful function if you start to run out of RAM and can prevent your system from going OOM. But in its default configuration, swapping occurs *much* more often than it needs to. This doesn't really matter if you're using an SSD as the disk is fast enough that it still performs well. But when you're using an SD card for storage the slow I/O can bog down your system and cause ""stuttering"" or brief lock-ups. Luckily, we can fix that.

Linux respects a value called ""swappiness."" I won't go into the details of the equation (Red Hat has some good information about it) but essentially a higher value of swappiness causes the system to use swap when when there is no memory pressure (meaning, the system is filling the available RAM) while a low value of swappiness will cause the system to only swap when there is memory pressure. Swappiness can range from 0-100 and most Linux distributions define a value of 60. You can check how it is set on your system in the terminal:

`cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness`

(This is a read-only operation so no risk. You can read up on [proc here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html) but it exposes some properties of the kernel via a user-accessible filesystem.) In a default Raspbian install that will return `60`. To reduce this, edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` with root permission with your favorite command-line text editor (vi, nano, etc...).

`sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf` or `sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf`

The file will be fully commented out unless you have edited it previously. Just add the following line to the end of the file:

`vm.swappiness=0`

Save and reboot. You should see that `cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness` will now return 0. This does *not* disable swap, but makes it so the system will only use it if it absolutely needs to. You *can* disable swap completely but I do not really recommend it unless you have 4GB+ of RAM as it can lead to OOM situations."

raspberry_pi,“Sharp” sensors,"Hello, I have 4 distance sensors, 2 “sharp gp2y0a02yk0f” and 2 “sharp gp2y0a21yk0f”. Both operate on 4.5-5.5 V. 

In my case they are giving wrong numbers, not only occasionally but consistently. One of the sensors always output 1.0+V even if there is no object on the way (it should output less than 0.5 according to data sheet)

I checked voltage and current across everything and noticed that current drawn from raspberry pi is only 90 or so mAmps while according to the datasheet one sensor should consume at least 30mAmps up to 50 hence total consumption should be 120-200mAmps. Can this be the reason for wrong readings? I am very confused…

Also I have to recalibrate them way too often which I also find weird.

Thank you for help."

raspberry_pi,How to set up a WaveShare7600 GPS tracker with Googles Maps on Android App that I will build," I just want to say that I have no experience with Raspberry Pi or Android programming. I've used Arduino Uno back then but nothing really extensive. I'd appreciate it if you can use simple terms so I can easily understand or send me links with explanation that I can use. It's a project I'm forced to do supposedly with a teammate but he hasn't responded to my messages for 2 weeks already. It's quite unfortunate because he's the one who knows about these things. I'm more of a front end web developer and still working on my back end skills.

The project is for wheelchair users. When the gyroscope sensor detects a change in axes or ultrasonic sensor comes into contact with an obstacle, it will notify through your mobile app that the wheelchair may have tipped over or got hit. You can check the app and track the wheelchair's location so family members can check up on them.

I haven't tried yet but I think I can manage how to make the WaveShare SIM7600 display the coordinates on the computer. My issue is the communication part on how to translate these coordinates and display it on google maps on the mobile app.

Also, how do I send notifications when the gyroscope detects a change or ultrasonic sensor collides with an obstacle? There are a lot of third party apps like IFTTT, Zapier and Pushover but I want it to send notifications directly to my own mobile app."

raspberry_pi,Android build for RPi 3b w/ out-of-box support for SPI/DSI screens?,"Subject TL;DR

I've been looking into trying to get a build of Android running on one of my spare 3b's to mess around with. However the two top results I've found, EmteriaOS and [this] (https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi3/LineageOS17.1/) LineageOS build seem to only support HDMI based displays but not any of the SPI or DSI based ones on the market. Curious if anyone knows of any Android builds that exist that do support these.

I probably will eventually get an HDMI screen for this project should my plans work out, but what I have on hand is just a couple WaveShare SPI screens that I'd like to be able to use in the interim."

`sudo python /home/pi/program.py`

I have tried using rc.local and crontab to run it at startup. When I tried using the desktop autostart method, it crashed my raspberry pi and forced me to completely reinstall the operating system. 

I have no experience with raspberry pi or python so this may be incredibly simple, but I have wasted more than a few hours at this point and am out of ideas"

raspberry_pi,PiHoleVPN on Pi zero,"I set up a pi hole a few months ago and recently added a PiVPN using the wire guard protocol/service to it. It is running pi os lite and I did a headless install to have as little overhead as possible.  The PiHole potion works well at home and functions over VPN however the VPN connection speed is the issue.

The VPN works however the VPN connection is extremely slow.  Like file transfers from my NAS are kbps regardless of the network I'm on while away so I don't believe it's the ISP throttling the connection or the port traffic unless it's my home ISP that is throttling it.  I used the normal wire guard port during set up, port 52820 I believe.

I set the VPN up with AES 256 encryption and have it plugged into my router via USB 2.0 to 100 mbps Ethernet adapter. Using wire guard and not OpenVPN.

I have done some research but still have not solved this issue.  Things I have tried are:
using different internet sources (including my phone hotspot), connecting from a different device, verifying the load and temps of the pi are normal, watching the upload and download rates of the pi from my router (up is about 2-3 Mbps while transferring a 2 GB file)

Is this too much for a pi zero or is there something that I'm missing/should try to do to speed up the connection?

I have found post with people having similar issues with the pi B's but only coming up with temporary solutions to the issue.  I leave for a month if not more at a time so I'm trying to find a more permanent fix.

I appreciate any advice.  I am a system admin with limited networking knowledge."

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/onokq8/2021_jul_19_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
2. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: What model of Raspberry Pi do I need so I can watch YouTube in a browser?  
A: [No model of Raspberry Pi is capable of watching YouTube smoothly through a web browser, you need to use VLC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kocdez/which_if_any_raspberry_pi_is_powerful_enough_to/)
11. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
12. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things? Can a Raspberry Pi run Pi-hole and something else at the same time?  
A: **YES**. Pi-hole uses almost no resources. You can run Pi-hole at the same time on a Pi running Minecraft which is one of the biggest resource hogs. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
13. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
14. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
15. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
16. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
17. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
20. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
21. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oo46ih/i_mapped_a_few_trrs_cables_to_the_rca_connectors/).
22. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: A Raspberry Pi is a full computer running Linux and doesn't use special stripped down embedded microcontroller versions of standard Linux software. Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux. Also See question #1.
24. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it with an Arduino. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi Pico?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Arduino, a Pico can be used with the Arduino IDE.
25. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

Often after running fine for multiple days, it stops communicating:

Emby clients on other machines cannot access the Emby server.

I cannot log in with ssh

I cannot log in using Remote Desktop Protocol

However, the PI still responds to ping requests.  I have to power it off and on again to restore normal functions.

Where would I look for log files to help diagnose what is wrong?  Since the PI is headless, I can only look for evidence after the problem has happened."

Now monitor 2 have a black border. If I disable overscan, the TV has its screen spill off. 

If I set the TV to have a resolution of ""1360*768"", it dont have its contents spill off. But now the monitor 2 cannot display the whole screen, only a portion of it.

raspberry_pi,How do I backup a Raspberry Pi image and run in virtual environment,"I have an old raspberry pi computer out at one of my client's sites and we want to understand how it is working. It seems to be one of the very first versions of the Pi, I can't tell what it is specifically because it is mounted and would make a mess if I needed to take it out (I can do this if required though).

What I have tried to do is connect the SD Card into my windows machine, run Win32DiskImager read and then run that ISO inside Virtualbox. 

When launching the image via VirtualBox I am getting the error ""FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted."".

I understand the error message but not the problem, I was guessing that potentially the image was raw and had to be converted to another type of file?

This would give me benefits of:

1) Saving time from switching OSes

2) Energy efficiency (I guess a RP4 would consume far less energy than an entertainment desktop PC)

My question is: 

1) Can a Pi handle this for a long period of time? 

2) How is it performance with 2 external monitor connected?

3) Would an SD card do the job as a primary hard disk? Should I find a way to replace it with an SSD?"

What I didn't do during that whole week was change the username and pw for Pi. I used the browser a few times on the Pi and probably connected using VNC viewer \~4 times using another PC on the same network. Now i'm trying to change the username of the Pi and it says I can't because 'user pi is currently being used by process....'. I logged out and on root I used 'kill all -username' but it keeps giving me that error.  Does this mean my Pi has been compromised?"

raspberry_pi,Possible to use a raspberry pi 4 to stream existing videos to twitch?,"I have already seen plenty of posts stating that using a raspberry pi with a camera attached it technically is possible, albeit difficult and not that optimal, to stream video to a twitch channel.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my question is slightly different. The current idea that I have is to start a twitch stream, which would be running 24/7, that would loop through youtube videos from a specific channel and display one video at a time in the twitch stream. The idea is similar to the \[YogsCinema twitch stream\]([https://yogscast.fandom.com/wiki/YogsCinema](https://yogscast.fandom.com/wiki/YogsCinema)), although a different channel, with permission ofcourse, will be used. The most intensive tasks of the raspberry pi would essentially be loading the youtube videos and streaming it to the twitch channel.

&amp;#x200B;

Is the aforementioned idea possible using only a raspberry pi?"

It's quite a common mod ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e58NVuxSWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e58NVuxSWE)) that people have achieved in many different ways with many different screens, but I want to create something that only uses one cable and a slightly smaller screen.

The reason I'm posting here is because every time I look up something to do with this I usually end up coming across raspberry pi type screens, and I'm just not involved enough with any other maker groups that I know a good place to ask...

Hopefully what I'm looking for isn't too far away from what you guys might know about, or you might at least be able to point me in the right direction :)

In an ideal world I'm looking for two components:  
**6 inch square screen:** As you can see in the video the 7inch screen fits perfectly vertically, but increases the size of the housing horizontally. I'd like to avoid this. Looks like 600x600 res would be fine, but happy with any resolution.

**USB controller board:** A controller board that uses a single cable for both power and data means I don't have to use up outputs on my graphics card (already using three of them...) and I don't need to find extra power sockets (my ""cockpit"" is very much something that I attach to my desk to fly then put away later, so less cables is always better)   


Any help would be massively appreacited. Thanks in advance!

I checked a few logs and there isn’t any obvious error that I can see, but I’m no Linux expert. Any ideas or suggestions on where/how to diagnose this issue? It will just stay like this where I can ping but do nothing else until I unplug it.

* Different ports
* Verifying that the display is working on the television
* Trawled through google and unfortunately there seems to be a lot of instances of this problem, and people not getting results.  


Below are some key config settings:  


    server-option = --port=9000

    ### HTTPS options:
    server-option = --use-ssl=yes
    server-option = --ssl-private-key-file=/HIDDENPATH
    server-option = --ssl-certificate-file=/HIDDENPATH

    ### WebRTC options:

### These options are specific to the HTTP/HTTPS Server
    ### serving custom Web pages only:
    server-option = --enable-www-server=yes
server-option = --www-port=443
    server-option = --www-use-ssl=yes
    server-option = --www-ssl-private-key-file=/HIDDENPATH
    server-option = --www-ssl-certificate-file=/HIDDENPATH

Iv heard using a wifi adapter, such as the Panda PAU09, can help increase these speeds, but I can’t find out by how much. allegedly 300Mbits/s, but I’m not sure if one would start running into hardware limits on the Pi board before hitting those max speeds.

-----
__Longer Version__

I'm writing up a proposal and specs to deploy some units to another country (developed in US, deployed to Juba, South Sudan).  I was planning on going with [Raspberry Pi 400 Computer Kits](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/?variant=raspberry-pi-400-us-kit) as the workstations, and something based on the [Argon One M.2](https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-m-2-case-for-raspberry-pi-4.html) for something we would call the 'Server'.

I'm not too worried about the workstations since they won't have any individualized data on them.  We can always toss in a replacement sd card if needed.

As far as the 'server' goes - I'm just curious as to what would be the most stable/cost effective method for the OS and data to be housed that is least prone to corruption and needing to be replaced."

raspberry_pi,Installing Raspberry Pi OS on Argon One M.2 without a SD card,"I got a full kit with a Raspberry Pi 4, the Argon One M.2, and a M.2 drive.

I followed the instructions on installing the OS on the SD card to then install the OS on the SSD drive.

Unfortunately, the SD card was old and just died on me. After trying recover the SD card and not finding any other spare card, I decided to take the bottom half of the case and connect a USB-A to USB-C to the laptop. The drive was immediately recognised as a USB drive and I initialized it in MBR mode. After that, I just used the official Raspberry imager tool to copy the OS directly to the M.2 SSD drive.

After that, I joined both halves of the Argon case and I was able to boot the Raspberry Pi without the need for a SD card.

Maybe this is obvious but hopefully this will help someone else stuck in a similar situation."

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux.
24. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

I'm not prioritizing low latency, high fps, or high resolution for the browser ""live feed"". In fact, a browser live feed isn't strictly needed for my case.

Mostly I'm just interested in ""copy"" recording to usb hard drive (at high resolution and frame rate), triggered by motion events (which can be triggered by low resolution or framerate streams, if that helps save cycles) 

I realize the motion events are quite computationally expensive, but my understanding is that ffmpeg compiled with --enable-mmal will use the rpi gpu to do the decoding and should be very fast. Is this true?

I would also like to prioritize ease of clip browse/playback in the browser.

raspberry_pi,Bring On The Fuzzbusters! Raspberry Pi Radar HAT Project Update,"Hello fellow Raspberry Pi enthusiasts! Last week I posted [an intro to our little radar HAT project](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oigg74/look_ma_no_camera_radar_hat_for_raspberry_pi/) on this sub and you guys showed incredible interest which I'm very thankful for. Here is a quick update on our development efforts so far.

I figured a short video is better than many words. I'm no pro video editor so you'll have to excuse my poor skills :) In this video I demo real-time activity monitoring using radar on the Raspberry Pi. The data is then sent to our web server for display (this produces a bit of lag as the web server is en Europe so keep that in mind).

![video](2rku3tmm71c71 ""Radar HAT Demo"")

Firstly, I show that the radar can reflect upon simple activities such as hand waving. It is capable of detecting tiny changes in the environment so it's great as an accurate occupancy detection device!

Obviously the entire project is made paw-sibile by Nami and Lovely, my fluffy radar HAT develo-purrs =\^ω\^= consider the cat tax paid!

In the last few seconds of the video, I demo a higher activity spike by performing some jumping around (poor neighbors) and finally I demo our live histogram feature by walking across the detection area of the sensor.

![img](lj13tf4u71c71 ""Live Activity View - Top: Raw Log, Bottom: Histogram (10s Buckets)"")

As shown above, the live histogram breaks activity into 10-second buckets in real time! The activities are classified and counted by severity: low, mid and high. 

Lastly (not shown on video), I go to bed and pretend to sleep - after no physical movement is detected (a bit hard to fake), the radar switches to respiration mode and monitors my breathing pattern as shown below:

![img](31h5mn9g81c71 ""Live Respiration Activity Log on Android / Chrome [public address redacted for privacy]"")

I monitored my own respiration pattern with my phone and took the above screen cap - YAY to reactive web-based apps :)

So ... 

What's working:

* Radar interface to the Raspberry Pi (tested with Rpi3B and Rpi4)
* Data parsing and signal shaping in real time
* SDK to get radar data in real time
   * Subscription event functions for:
      * No activity
      * Low activity
      * Medium activity
      * High activity
      * Respiration activity value
      * Respiration active (yes / no)
      * Presence / occupancy (yes / no)
   * Function to configure the detection distance
   * Function to calibrate sensor to new environment
   * BLE low-level interface (full implementation)
   * Web client data interface
* Basic web UI to display real-time data
* Variable power modes (supports multiple voltages as input)

What needs more work:

* SDK analytics
   * Sleep analysis functions
   * Fall detection event subscription
* Enclosure and other physical related work
* A lot more - will be covered in future updates!

What data-analysis feature (or SDK function call) would you like to see if this device was in your hands today? Please let me know!"

When plugged in the power led lights red, but no activity led flashing with or w/o card and hdmi seems dead too. The card is good and display is OK with my laptop.

So I looked at the board with magnification and noticed some SMD may be missing.

I didn't found any official layouts and  blueprints to identify what is supposed to be there, but came with quick hack to overlay some official photos onto mine and check what's differ.

It came out that not only 4 smd elements are not here, but the board I have has 2 new pieces.

I marked missing with minus and new as plus on the picture attached.

I saw that there is seemingly only one revision of the board so I'm pretty confused about what I have in my hands here?"

raspberry_pi,AirJukeBox: A white noise machine / simple remote Juke Box,"Hi!

I have made a little project for someone who wanted to buy a 50$ white noise machine on Amazon and proposed them to make one myself instead. Maybe it can be of interest for someone else here.

Basically it's an audio player running on a Raspberry Pi using Python and Django that can be controlled using a web interface from other devices connected to the same WiFi network (e.g. smartphone, laptop, etc.).

The purpose of it is to connect a Raspberry Pi to a stereo system in your house (or a speaker) and to your home WiFi and be able to control it remotely (using a web browser) without using Bluetooth. It started has a simple white noise machine for sleeping or relaxing but it's not limited to white noise. You can also think of it as a background music system that you can find in stores, just set it and forget it.

The functionalities include:

* Play: Play the selected song, it will play all songs in the directory in order and then stop.
* Stop: Stop the audio player.
* Loop: Play all songs in the directory and loop back at the end.
* Random: Play all songs in the directory in random order. Can be combined with ""Loop"".
* Volume: Control the main device's sound volume.
* Cutoff timer: Automatically stop the audio player after the selected number of minutes. Can be enabled or disabled.
* Add song from YouTube: Download the audio from the video provided with the YouTube link and convert it to .OGG.
* Upload song: Upload a song from the user's device to the AirJukeBox 'Songs/' directory.
* Delete song: Delete a song from the 'Songs/' directory.

&amp;#x200B;

A picture of the web interface can be found [here](https://imgur.com/plldguA).

If you are interested you will find all the instructions and other information on the project's README on the [Github page](https://github.com/vdouet/AirJukeBox).

It was tested with a Raspberry Pi 4 using Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) version from 2021-05-07. It should also work on Ubuntu and other Linux distros provided that amixer and ffmpeg are installed (for sound volume control and YouTube audio .ogg conversion). It also works on Windows and MacOS but it's not the topic of this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

raspberry_pi,"Pi 4 8GB version, Any 64 Bit os that actually utilizes the 8GB of RAM ?","I've had Manjuro, Raspberry Pi OS beta and Ubuntu so far. Nothing works. 

Raspberry OS (64bit beta) works fine over VNC but I was never able to get HDMI working, I've asked on the forums multiple times and nobody was ever able to help, great.

So I switched to Manjuro. And Manjuro was just painfully slow. HDMI worked this time but I didn't even completely set up the system because of just how unbearably slow everything was.

So I gave up and tried Ubuntu 64 Bit. It works except this time HDMI dies after upgrading the system, same story with the forums. There's no point if you can't even update&amp;upgrade your system at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Having a functional operating system is a must and so far I've not found one. The Pi 4 8GB version is a great idea on paper but in my eyes a massive flop in the real world, not just from lacking a basic functional 64bit os but also from the software side.

Does anyone have any recommendation for a 64 Bit OS with actual support. Parrot OS were promising since 2017 that an ARM port is just around the corner, nothing since and it seems like it's being pushed back with every year passing. I would gladly pay for an OS that works and has great support, GLADLY!"

raspberry_pi,Rasperry PI 4- 4GB: PoE+ hat creates static noise.,"I am building a Raspberry pi cluster which currently will contain 2 raspberry pi4 with 4 gb of ram.

Because of the issue of finding a USB powerhub with 3.0A i decided to buy the [PoE+ hat](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/raspberry-pi-poe-plus-hat?search=poe&amp;description=true).  To power it with with a [Tp-Link Tl-Sg1005P](https://www.amazon.nl/Tp-Link-Tl-Sg1005P-Gigabit-Poe-Ondersteuning-Behuizing/dp/B0763TGBTS), which is being delivered tomorrow.

To try and see if this thing works i installed the PoE+ hat on the raspberry pi, and try to power it on with a the Official Raspberry Pi USB C power supply.

Now when I power the pi there is a kind of static noise which only exists when I power the pi on with the hat.

Does this sound exists because the power is not comming from the Ethernet cable or is the Hat broken or how can i fix this.

I've decided to setup Hyperbian for my TV and have everything either set up or ordered. The only thing I have left to do is set up the power supply.

raspberry_pi,Ransomware (.0xxx) infected my Pi!,"Hi everyone! Some months ago I set up an old Pi to run Pihole + SMB + Deluge and have remote access to my network share. It had been running undisturbed day and night more than three months. 

Earlier today, I rebooted the Pi while doing some cable management and when I tried to FTP into my network folder I found out that all the files have been encrypted with a .0xxx extension. A txt file in the root instructed me on how to pay the ransom and retrieve the decryption key, courtesy of some Russian guy.

Fortunately the files on the drive were very trivial and replaceable, but it got me a bit paranoid on how the virus spread and what to do with the infected drive(s). Do I need to get rid of it or can I attempt to format it through ssh? Should I dispose of the SD card of my Pi as well?

I wasn't able to find many many info on this kind of ransomware but it appears to also affect NAS (mainly by Western Digital). If you have any additional info on how it may spread or how to avoid it in the future it would be a great discussion!

Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a single Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin.

21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux.
24. Q: I'm trying to do something with Bluetooth and it's not working, how do I fix it?  
A: It's well established that Bluetooth and Linux don't get along, this is problem is not unique to the Raspberry Pi.

raspberry_pi,Raspbian Lite - RPi Zero keyboard works only on very rare occasions,"Tested the RPi Zero on the same hardware but using an SD card I was using with another RPi with Raspbian desktop on it, and it operated normally.

From the RPi I'm using a micro-usb-&gt;usb adapter and then a usb-&gt;mini-usb cable to my keyboard. On Raspbian Lite with no desktop so I can't test a mouse or anything. Lights on keyboard *do* come on for a second or two (as is normal) upon the keyboard being connected, so it is clearly powered. But there's no response on the login prompt and the capslock/numlock/scrolllock keys don't activate their respective lights. I do not own another keyboard to test this with.

The keyboard HAS worked on this setup, which is what is confusing me. Once when I plugged it in during startup and once when I plugged it in at the login screen. Can't be a driver issue if it has worked, and I doubt that Raspbian lite wouldn't have generic keyboard drivers. For troubleshooting, I haven't managed to get wifi working yet so I can't SSH into it. What even is this issue?"

raspberry_pi,Files missing after power failure,"Yesterday I came to the Pi and found the power cord loose. After plugging it back in, I get a kernel panic along the lines of ""/sbin/init not found"". Ouch, there much be some filesystem corruption.

I removed the sd card, and after thrashing around trying to get cygwin to mount it I gave up, booted into a live Arch environment on my laptop, and plugged in the sd card.

Running fsck gave no errors, but it did say `19/&lt;number&gt;` files. Hm. I think I had a lot more than 19 files on that thing.

Sure enough, after mounting the ext4 partition I find all the files gone. There's a few empty folders (`boot`, `media`, `run`, `proc`, etc), but not a single file. Doesn't look like the partition table got corrupted -- `fdisk -l` shows everything as normal (an [intact] boot partition and a regular ext4 partition extending through the disk).

Any ideas on fixing this, or at the very least recovering a few of those files? Apologies if this would best be posted in a different subreddit."

raspberry_pi,"Look Ma, No Camera! Radar HAT for Raspberry Pi!","Computer vision without a camera, and much more! My colleague and I are building a little Raspberry Pi HAT with a RADAR sensor on it. We are going to use it for a smart home project, but we see many other applications for it. Our motive behind building it is mostly privacy-related; we wanted to avoid using cameras. The radar unit can be used to detect respiration, sleeping and movement patterns and we are working on few other scenarios. This is what it looks like, plus an obligatory banana for scale.

[RADAR Sensor &amp; Banana for Scale](https://preview.redd.it/sriy2jjveoa71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e88ea589cb494a83c8873c83d74f95f3214644d)

We think using it as a baby-monitor without having a creepy camera is an interesting use-case; it can also be used in bathrooms to monitor occupancy and slip and falls. We've built a little web-app to monitor the data stream coming out of the radar HAT. The web-app can be used to find trends in the data stream (pretty graphs and alerts and such). Here is an example of activity and sleep pattern in a one studio apartment.

[Sample Sleep Analysis Data](https://preview.redd.it/6u834jm0foa71.jpg?width=1460&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc549b0e5714a0a35b2546bbd751b6ed166ff762)

We are still experimenting with it, but I figured others might find this hat interesting. Let us know your thoughts!"

I also have two cables attached to the GPIO pins from the board, too the Pi. The one for voltage is connected to pin one, and the one for ground is connected to pin six.

- 2 Displays
- Genesis/Snes emulator with 2 player support
- Movies

Power supplied by inverter under driver seat, ignition accessory wired.

From what I understand, I want the following:

- rp4 8gb
- A UPS for shutting down when accessory power is off, does this work for the rp4? : https://www.pishop.us/product/ups-pico-uninterruptible-power-supply-i2c-control-hat/
- A method for connecting 2 wireless controllers and two wireless headphones.
- hard drive for game/movie storage

With all that forward, am I missing anything? Is there also a way to tie in a Roku/Chromecast for casting? 

What kind of gui will make it easy for a 6 year old to toggle between games or movies?

I'm super new to the raspberry pi world so any help/pointers/ guides are great.

raspberry_pi,Turn your Raspberry pi in to a Network Speed Test Machine. Easy to use Docker Image. HTML5 GUI,"You can run a Network Speed Test FROM any Browser that is **IE10** or NEW.

 **Raspberry pi  install instructions:**

Install Docker and run the following command!

1. **docker run --restart=unless-stopped --name openspeedtest -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 openspeedtest/latest**
2. Now open your browser and direct it to:

A: For HTTP use: [http://YOUR-Server-IP:3000](http://your-nas-ip:3000/)

B: For HTTPS use: [https://YOUR-](https://your-nas-ip:3001/)[Server](http://your-nas-ip:3000/)[-IP:3001](https://your-nas-ip:3001/)

TLDR: For 10Gbps You need Latest Hardware, Use Safari or Chrome in Private Window or Incognito Window.

For Testing 10GbE you will need to use latest hardware. I used M1 MacMini with Built-in 10GbE &amp; Linux Machine with 3900XT.

Safari is the Fastest browser.

Chrome and Chromium Edge can handle 10Gbps or more in MacOS and Linux.

Tested up to 10Gbps on real NIC and up to 30Gbps on Virtual NIC .

You can test more than 10Gbps with Chrome or Safari on M1 Mac or new.

Or Linux with Chrome or Chromium with a 3900XT or Similar Processor.

up to 2.5 Gbps can be tested on almost all popular browser and devices.

Windows max limit is around 8.5 Gbps Download and 9.4Gbps for Upload. Tested on Edge and Chrome.

Use Private Window or Incognito Window if you Found Unusual test results. Probably some Extensions are slowing the speed test process.

This tool can be used to check the browser performance and impact of Extensions on your browsing Experience.

Works on Any Device with a Web Browser that is IE10 or New. That including you Smart TV, Console etc.

Docker image run better on Linux Platforms including Your NAS. But if you install docker on MacOS or Windows you may see poor performance. I asked this on Docker forums and they told me MacOS and Windows support is for Development purpose only. For Production you need to use any Linux Platform.

Same Story goes to Windows NGINX. Nginx use only one worker even if you specify n number of worker process. They will show in Task Manager but system will only use one. This is directly from Nginx website.

For Windows as a Server you can test up to 10Gbps or more in HTTP using Nginx but HTTPS performance was under 1Gbps in my testing.

You can download Simple Speed Test Server With GUI for Windows, Mac and Linux [https://go.openspeedtest.com/Server](https://go.openspeedtest.com/Server) It will support HTTP only and you can test 10 to 15Gbps with this application."

Xfinity/Comcast broadcasts a second SSID from most home routers now. It’s “xfinitywifi”, and Comcast customers can log into a landing page and get WiFi in a surprising number of places. 

This network shows up on my iPhone, my MacBook, and my vehicle’s Android head unit. 

It does not appear at all on Raspbian using a Pi Zero. A scan with a network utility on Raspbian shows a hidden SSID that I suspect is ""xfinitywifi,"" but it says it has WPA2 security. The SSID is unsecured on my other devices. 

My locale data is correctly set, and I believe it's being broadcast on channels the Pi has access to. 

My goal is to use these networks for a GPS tracker. Right now, my vehicle's head unit seamlessly connects to these networks as I drive around, and I get weather and traffic updates. But I don't understand how, or why, the network isn't even visible to my Pi Zero W."

raspberry_pi,"My raspberry keeps my ssd warm, is it bad? Why?","Hello,

This week I bought a raspberry pi 4 (4Gb) to experiment a bit with Linux and dockers, run PiHole and keep a backup of my data (approx. 400Gb in total, of which 40-50Gb are rewritten per month).

To save that backup what I have done is to install Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit) with OpenMediaVault 5 on a MicroSD, connect a 1TB WD My Passport SSD to a USB 3.0 port, and share the root of the SSD as a network folder on my local network (SAMBA). This way, I can access the SSD from any computer on my internal network and upload/download stuff from that SSD.

I thought this would be a good idea (my understanding is that an SSD only wears out the more you write to it, not because of the hours it's on, but it can lose data if it stays unplugged for too long, so great to leave it plugged into a raspberry, I think), but I have two problems:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Does the raspberry (pi OS, with OMV) take care of a USB-connected SSD automatically, or do I have to do something? Things like TRIM etc. I don't know if they activate themselves, and if the default configuration can damage the life of my SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

2) I have noticed that even if the Raspberry has no use (nobody accesses the files etc.), it seems that the SSD is still active, because it is all the time ""hot"", approximately at about 30-35 degrees celsius. is it normal? Shouldn't it ""shut down"" when not in use to preserve it better? I'm worried that being connected all the time and generating heat will soon kill my SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your experiences? Thank you very much!!!"

raspberry_pi,Solar-Powered Raspberry Pi Zero Streaming Camera,"Hey y'all,

So I've been tweaking this solar-powered Raspberry Pi Zero camera housing in Fusion 360 for the last couple months. I think I've finally figured it out! I now have a functional prototype! I just mounted it outside today and I'm going to be monitoring it for the next few weeks to make sure it can hold up in the heat and rain. Then I'll post the STL and Fusion 360 files on Thingyverse with a full detailed tutorial on my blog for anyone that wants to build it.

I'm just really excited about my prototype and I wanted to share. Here are some features I built in:

\- Ball-and-socket joints for the solar panel and camera for adjustability

\- Exposed Raspberry Pi heat sink for heat dissipation

\- Power switch and solar power input hidden under the little hat (the solar panel mount) for weatherproofing. Also sealed the seams with silicone.

I started this project to make a simple security camera that is actually secure (updated ""firmware""/OS, encrypted traffic, maybe even antivirus). But then I went down the rabbit hole of ""well, I should design my own case"" and ""well, I want it solar-powered"". I've been wanting to setup a secure NVR system too, so I plan on doing that with ZoneMinder and WireGuard. I know this isn't the subreddit for all that, but if you're interested, you can read about the details of this project here:

[https://www.hannahtech.co/post/coming-soon-solar-powered-security-camera-and-securing-your-home-security-system](https://www.hannahtech.co/post/coming-soon-solar-powered-security-camera-and-securing-your-home-security-system)

All the Pi has to do is stream the video and connect to the VPN. The CPU usage is pretty low (under 20%) with mjpg-streamer-- much better than 90-100+% CPU usage with motion. 

Once I get all this figured out, I'll design one for Raspberry Pi 4 + 4G LTE modem for anyone that wants to setup a trail cam or something to access remotely."

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.
23. Q: I want to do something that has been well documented and there are numerous tutorials showing how to do it on Linux. How can I do it on a Raspberry Pi?  
A: Follow one of the tutorials for doing it on Linux.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Components for a bat detector - is there such a thing as an i2s mems microphone that goes up towards 100kHz?,"For some context, I'm really keen to build a bat detector, and it would be great if I could use one of my Raspberry Pis to act as the guts. Perhaps display some of the waveforms, do a bit of species identification, save the recordings, etc.

Options for the microphone... 

A standalone usb microphone such as:  https://www.dodotronic.com/product/ultramic-um192k/?v=2a47ad90f2ae - fits the bill, but very expensive for a small project.

Something like this https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-i2s-mems-microphone-breakout-sph0645lm4h - cheap, but the frequency only goes up to normal hearing range.

Or something like this https://micbooster.com/ultrasonic-microphones/146-ultrasonic-mic-board.html - cheap, but is that outputting analog i.e. do I need an additional ADC to interface with the Raspberry Pi?

I'm not quite sure what it is that I'm after... Option 3 but with an i2s interface that I can connect directly to the Pi?

Anyone tried a similar project?"

I bought the PiSugar 2 Pro and I'm using it with a Pi 4 B.

As an experiment, I installed the software on Raspbian, and it worked. I tried installing on Ubuntu, but critical components are missing, so it failed.

Looking at the Wiki, there's [an option to compile for Ubuntu](https://github.com/PiSugar/pisugar-power-manager-rs?fbclid=IwAR3nx9Pq9aAILuouyXpvhR_m9bPQmD3l5DJgjZqyR-NAQ-oy1LtLZ-LcPMU#cross-compilation---linuxubuntu-musl).

Problem is, I'm not sure what the Rust target and build options need to be.

Raspberry's own documentation states it's an ARM v8, but the options are 6, 7, and 64 — so would ARM64 be the correct option?

Any advice would be great!"

raspberry_pi,Black screen when I try to connect a monitor or any screen to the Raspberry Pi 4 B+. Short circuit.,"I was using Raspberry Pi 4+ B for my 3D printer. So, it was always connected from USB to the motherboard of the 3D printer. Two days ago, somehow was created a short circuit on my motherboard on the 3D printer. It burned all the mother board.

The raspberry was connected in that moment to the 3D printer (and in the same way powered with 5v from plug). I tried to connect my raspberry pi to a new motherboard. I saw that it is not identified via wi-fi and I can't acces his IP on web page. So, I tried to reinstall the system. Using the raspberry pi Imager I installed Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) on SD card and I noticed that anyway, there is not even image on display.

I tried 2 different SD card, I tried again to reinstall the system, nothing helped. I tried to use a ethernet cable to connect to my router, but the green led of the ethernet is not even blinking, not even glowing.

The green led ACT is always green. If the SD card is insterted or even if it is not, the green light of ACT is always glowing, but not blinking.

Also, I tried from Raspberry Pi Imager ""Misc utility images"" for EEPROM recovery, but didn't help. The screen is not even turning on.

I tried 3 different screens, smart TV using HDMI, a PC monitor and my laptop. None of them show image of the raspberry PI.

The red light of the POWER is working and always glows when I power the raspberry. Also the fan too turns on.

Please, help. I guess the problem is in the hardware, what component could burn?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry\_pi/comments/oax2dy/the\_desktop\_music\_player\_in\_its\_final\_form/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oax2dy/the_desktop_music_player_in_its_final_form/)

A lot of people wanted to see pictures of how I put it together, so I took some pics of the guts.  So here we go.

**First Off: Parts List**

1. Raspberry Pi 4B with 4 GB of RAM (You don't need to use this. A 3B+ will work just fine too.)
2. HiFiBerry DAC2 HD (Any DAC HAT will do. This is just the one I picked.)
3. Official Raspberry Pi Touch Screen
4. Official Raspberry Pi USB-C Power Supply
5. [SmartiPi Pro Case With Large Back](https://www.amazon.com/SmartiPi-Touch-Pro-Raspberry-Touchscreen/dp/B08VSFZDDT)
6. [2 foot pliable RCA Cables](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AYB5KHW) (Use whatever length you think you will need)
7. [90 Degree RCA elbows](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068O41)
8. [40 pin GPIO ribbon cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D991KMR)
9. Heat sinks and thermal pad (for the places you normally put heat sinks on Raspberry Pis)
10. [A VU Meter](https://www.ebay.com/itm/274416721555) (Optional)

The SmartiPi has excellent documentation on how to install to put it together, so I am not going to rehash that. Use the instructions that came with the case to install the screen and the fan. The case also has a place to mount a Pi Camera. You can mount one if you like. The music player doesn't need it. But you may want it for a future project.

**OS INSTALL**

Since you won't have access to the SD card slot once assembled, flash your OS of choice onto the SD Card slot (I used Raudio-1) and insert the card.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE ABOUT THE CASE**

Once the Raspberry Pi is in the case, you can't access the SD card. If you buy your case directly from SmartiPi, they sell a version with an SD card extender and a cutout in the case, so you can change SD cards. Sadly, I did not know this. I ordered the SD Card Extender from them, but I will need to cut the case myself.

**BACK CASE**

The first thing I did was install the fan and the power connector in the back case and drilled two holes that I could slide the RCA cables into. I used a step-up drill bit, so I am not sure what size the holes are. The RCA cables I bought were connected together.  I just grabbed one end and pulled them apart. The ends of the RCA cables just barely fit into the holes to get them to come out the other side:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](lsv1wcrj8w871 ""SmartiPi Back Case"")

**MOUNTING THE PI**

On the other side of the case, I mounted the Pi and the DAC. Follow the SmartiPi instructions for connecting the screen to the Pi.

![img](ga5ba3i89w871 ""Pi and DAC mounted"")

I used the 40 pin ribbon cable to connect the DAC to the Pi. This keeps the top of the Pi exposed, so hopefully the heat sink will work with the fan to keep it cool.

You need to mount the DAC using stand offs, since the ribbon cable needs to go under the DAC.

**RCA CABLES**

The RCA cables stick out too far to close the case comfortably.  You really need to force it closed, which put some undue strain the whole thing. So, I bought 90 degree adapters and used those.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](las7cml8aw871 ""RCA Cables Connected"")

**FINAL STEPS**

Connect the fan per instructions of the SmartiPi case.  Connect the power connector to the Pi and the screen per SmartiPi instructions. Install the port covers and gently close the lid, gently pulling the RCA cables to make sure you get the maximum length out of them.

Screw the back on, and it should look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](djnwqc0fbw871 ""Front"")

&amp;#x200B;

![img](uk5gz3pgbw871 ""Back"")

**INSTALL VU METER (OPTIONAL)**

If you want to give your music player some ""bling,"" you can install a VU meter. I bought one off of eBay. You run the RCA cable to the line in on the back of the VU meter, and then run another set of RCAs from the line out to your amp/powered speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

![video](byz6rormcw871 ""Music Player in Action"")

I attached the speakers VU meter to the bottom of the case using 3M Dual Lock squares.

Overall, this is a pretty simple build, but for me it's very satisfying.  It sits on my desk and allows me to play music off my NAS, and I can quickly pause what's playing when I get a call or need to join a meeting.

**FEATURES AND CONVENIECE ITEMS**

The features you get will be determined by your OS choice. Raudio-1 allows you to play local music and Spotify. If you choose Volumio, you'll be able to do Tidal and Quoboz also.

One item that I think is super convenient is an Ethernet cable with a 90° connector on the end. It keeps the cable from sticking out. Yes, this will work fine with Wi-Fi, but large library updates go faster over Ethernet.

Well, that's it. Feel free to ask any questions."
raspberry_pi,"Pihole, pain in my A-hole","Hi everyone,

I have tried to place pihole on my raspberry pi 3b with a padd display on a hyperpixel 4 non touch. I got everything to work but the display. So, whats my problem?

Well, im dumb and reformatted my SD card and refreshed raspian onto it (cause I didn't know how to Uninstall the PADD stuff) but here's my problem. Now whenever I plug my pi into my router via ethernet it shows as the same ip as it did before BUT my command prompt doesn't allow me to SSH into the pi because it says the ip has changed. So how do I stop my router from assigning the previous IP to my pi and use the new IP from it. (I deleted everything that I did on my DHCP settings on my router) it has a ""lease assigned time"" or something for the IP so maybe I just have to wait until that changed and it'll refresh the IP? Idk, Also, any one liners for installing pihole, padd and the drivers for hyperpixel would be a bonus but not needed. 

Thanks everyone"

I plan on writing a startup script which will take the pi to a borderless browser tab to display a website I made. The website only has a bit of text and styling, nothing crazy intensive. 

I tried running PI os in display_mode=3, but it would freeze on a blackscreen a little bit into the startup (the startup was in the correct portrait mode though.) I've checked a bunch of different online resources to try and figure out how to launch it--I have tried launching with gpu_mem at 128 and still no luck. I don't think it is a power issue. 

Aside from the portrait mode issue, I might also not be using the optimal operating system/ setup for this. Anyone have a suggestion on how I could set this up to be better in any way? Thanks!"

raspberry_pi,How to get a RPI program to autostart,"Hi, I have a program that I was able to setup successfully on the Raspberry Pi, It's called [hamclock](https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock/). 

**The question I have is how to make the program auto start each time the Pi is powered on?**

***Here's what I have tried:*** I opened the terminal and typed `sudo crontab -e` then I scrolled to the bottom of the terminal and typed `@reboot ./ESPHamClock/hamclock-fb0 &amp;`, I saved that and then rebooted the pi but the program did not autostart. Is there another method I should be using? Thanks!!!"

I have two uses. Retropie and vpn(pihole). Will this do all that? There are so many kits but I have nothing yet except for an 8bitdo sn controller(not the pro plus cause I read it had mapping problems to pc)

Also probable - streaming. Can I stream games or movies from my pc/steam? I know movies my internet will handle but I don’t even know if streaming games is possible. I don’t think these run steam since it’s windows only. 

I know I need the case and sd card/keyboard/mouse but this one doesn’t come with sd card reader. I know I can use a real HD via usb but either way I need a reader for the files on the card and would like to get everything at once but it kinda seems expensive to me but idk pricing each thing individually may be cheaper?

Should I get one formatted with noobs?"

raspberry_pi,RPi4-8G: Freeze when filecash is full,"Hi,

I'm running an RPi4 8 GB as main server and since about januari the device freezes the moment the file cache is full. Initially I suspected the firmware update I got then, but that's not the case. Same with kernel version, but returning to 4.x kernels didn't solve the issue. After re-activating collectd to grab data do I have at least a time when it freezes, I noticed that the device freezes when amount of free memory was to low (with swap on SSD unused)

I thought it was a memory problem, so I set the following sysctl options:

    vm.min_free_kbytes = 256000                                                                                                                                              
    vm.swappiness = 60                                                                                                                                                       
    vm.overcommit_memory = 2                                                                                                                                                 
    vm.overcommit_ratio = 100 

to prevent it ever to hit memory limits, but nop, it still freezes randomly when filecache is full. I removed the back-up function (moved to an RPi3) and it doesn't freeze as fast as it did when file cache is full, but it still freezes without a chance to log anything.

Are there tools to do hardware checks so I can try to monitor what happens when the device freezes?

I'm running Debian bullseye arm64 with kernel 5.10.40-1. It boots from SD, but all filesystems and swap is on SSD which is powered via USB. Only other thing I can think of is that flushing cache to SSD draws to much power when the CPU is busy as well. Any way to monitor the power input?"

raspberry_pi,How to turn 3v3 power on and off (e.g. with transistor)?,"Hello!

I have a project where I run a tiny water pump with the 3v3 power pin of Raspberry Pi. I planned to control the 3v3 power with code, but to my surprise RasPi does not support this, the power is always on.

What would be the most practical way to make a simple on/off switch for the 3v3 power that I could control with code? I've googled and read a few things about e.g. transistors and power circuits, but I'm struggling to find practical guides. 

For now I've gathered that I should maybe run the cable coming out of the 3v3 pin through a transistor and connect the base of the transistor to a GPIO pin. And then maybe do something with resistors and diodes so that the voltage doesn't change and the raspi doesn't blow up? I'm a little confused. Am I even on the right track or is there an easier way?"

My question is sometimes the ""cat /dev/ttyUSB0"" command will just stay running and display any input that comes in until I hit ^C and kill it.

It seems random relative to what else is going on, whats in the buffer etc. I know its a pretty niche question but anyone have an idea why?

Ive done some testing with the website only (made with Django) and I noticed that making changes to the models and writing the stuff on the DB takes a lot of time and some pages that require loading a considerable amount of data from it are bottlenecked by it. However, after looking at htop I noticed that it was barely using the CPU and RAM.

I think this has to do with the fact that it is using a micro SD card which is quite slow. My question is, if I boot the pi from a HDD a use it (with no overclocks) how fast can it deliver the data? Will it slow down the other components of the platform or will it keep up?"

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?

15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

I searched for possible answers on google for a while, but didn't find any solution for this, which is strange. I thought monitoring the pi using external components would be a more common topic. Maybe someone here has an idea?"

raspberry_pi,Pin only readable when set as output? (Using wiringpi Python on a Pi zero w),"So I am trying to use the pins GPIO5 and GPIO6 for buttons, but when reading them always results in High. Testing the pin does show \~3.3v on the pins, even when I just plugged Pi in. But if I set the pin as an output, the pin actually works as I expected.

Here is a demonstration:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.pinMode(6, 0) # Set pin mode to Input                                    
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.digitalRead(6)
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.digitalRead(6) # I started pressing here, it stays high
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.digitalRead(6)
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.pinMode(6, 1) # Set pin mode to Output                                                      
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.digitalRead(6) # The pin goes low
    0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.digitalRead(6)
    0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.digitalRead(6) # I started pressing here, and it goes high
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.digitalRead(6)
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt;

And here is from the `gpio readall` result:

Setting it as input, makes it go High (1)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.pinMode(6, 0)   
    |   6 |  22 | GPIO.22 |   IN | 1 | 31 |

Setting it as output, makes it go Low (0)

    &gt;&gt;&gt; wiringpi.pinMode(6, 1)  
    |   6 |  22 | GPIO.22 |  OUT | 0 | 31 |
    |   6 |  22 | GPIO.22 |  OUT | 1 | 31 | (Pressing the button)

I'm very confused why its like this. Is this how it's intended to work? Looking at [pinout.xyz](https://pinout.xyz) these pins just look like regular GPIO pins, with no special purpose. Why is it acting weird like this? all the other pins seem to work as expected. Also, is it okay to use these pins as inputs even if I set the pin mode as output? 

Thanks"

* updated kernel/firmware
* change S.O. installation to other SD
* install S.O. on USB flash drive
* ip address show wlan0 --&gt; Device wlan0 does not exist
* iw dev --&gt; nothing
* sudo iwlist wlan0 scan --&gt; wlan0     Interface doesn't support scanning.
* ifconfig wlan0 --&gt; wlan0: error fetching interface information: Device not found
* writed my connection on wpa\_supplicant.conf and reboot (not work)
* sudo ifup wlan0 --&gt; ifup: unknown interface wlan0
* sudo ifconfig wlan0 up --&gt; wlan0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No existe el dispositivo

I looked in different forums, I tried different linux distributions (old raspbian, ubuntu, fedora, ubuntu mate) but the result is the same, I think something bad has happened to the wifi module (is dead?), the bluetooth works correctly (I tried listening music)"

I just recently purchased 2 lg monitors from Best-Buy, and getting 1 of the monitors working was no problem, it worked out-of-the-box, but when I tried connecting the 2nd monitor, I got the rainbow screen?

I'm pretty sure it does not have to do with power-supply because I've already tried 2 different chargers: the official raspberry pi 4 charger(5.1V==3.0A) and Labists(5V==3000mA) plugged into a Belkin surge protector, and neither fixed this rainbow screen issue?

Also, xrandr could not detect the 2nd monitor and I was unable to get ddcutil to work(says ddc/ci option is not enabled for monitors, but I can't find the option in the monitors settings).

I slammed into a brick wall here, so, anymore tips on how to fix this issue?

I'm using two 2k LG monitors using the same amd/freesync/hdr technology.

Thanks in advance for the help!"

raspberry_pi,How to install Minecraft 1.17 Server on raspberry pi! (Posted by me 1 day ago in r/Minecraft),
raspberry_pi,Slow file transfer performance with a Raspberry Pi 3b+ even with external SSD,"Hi,

I understand the built-in SD card reader speed is limited on the RPi. I usually only get about 4MB/sec write speed, despite using a fairly fast SD card.

I bought an external enclosure and SSD drive. Achieving 130MB/sec read and write from my PC running Windows 10 (USB 3.0 port).

My understanding is that the RPi3b+ has a ""gigabit"" ethernet port (capable of 300mbps), and USB 2.0 ports (capable of 480mpbs).

When connecting my external enclosure to the Rpi and writing files to it via SCP, I would therefore expect at least 300mbps of transfer speed (or 30MB/sec) but I will still getting a poor write speed of about 9MB/sec.

Why???

Is there anyway to achieve 20MB/sec write speed on a Rpi3b+?"

I’d imagine using this for a lock. In my head, I’m thinking it would be two sides of it, the custom gameboy game would have a simple select menu where when you can scroll up and down and press start and select to go  throughout the menu but whenever you press any buttons it’ll set off a different path in the circuit board that the raspberry pi is connected too. The raspberry pi would just be following along with what it’s doing because it’d have 8 different paths to be listening out for with multiple different, if this then that type options to do with the info it’s reading. The game wouldn’t be reading anything from the pi, it’ll just be giving out things for the pi to take in and act upon. Does this sound like a cool project? I’d love to get it done if it’s even possible."

I figured I should try to play twitch and youtube videos with it because that's what I did when I first bought it. It took me over 40 minutes to install the dependencies I thought I needed, it was just streamlink, omxplayer and youtube-dl, nothing major. 

I tried streamlink first, but when I couldn't get it to work I tried omxplayer and youtube-dl, and it worked like a charm after a nerve wracking seemingly endless wait for the stream to start. 

That little puppy is purring along with just one cpu core and 256MB RAM, 75MB of which I dedicated to the gpu, but it soldiers on and plays 1080p 60fps twitch livestreams anyways! That's impressive!

This is where today's impressive and ridiculous projects come from, this was the origin.

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/o0032q/2021_jun_14_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Creating a pi capable of looping 4K," 

I have a h.265 4K video file which I need to loop infinitely for an art installation. From what I've been able to find online, my options are VLC media player and Kodi. However, I've tried both but neither has worked for me. once they loop, they both present a plethora of graphical glitches/distortions.

I have been unable to find a solution which allows me to loop 4K video seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi

Some specifications:

1. I have a 8 minute long video which I need to loop seamlessly infinitely.
2. The video is 4K resolution encoded with h.265 (From what I've read this is the only encoding format in which 4K will work on the raspberry pi 4.
3. I would strongly prefer if the video started playing as soon as the pi was turned on.
4. I have a raspberry pi 4 4gb model."

raspberry_pi,Portable screen issues...,"I bought a small 5 inch screen to carry around with my Pi, so that I could use it whereever I went. Sounded like a great plan. In the instructions, it said I had to add this code into my config file:

 

hdmi\_force\_edid\_audio=1 

max\_usb\_current=1 

hdmi\_force\_hotplug=1 

config\_hdmi\_boost=7 

hdmi\_group=2 

hdmi\_mode=1 

hdmi\_mode=87 

hdmi\_drive=1 

hdmi\_cvt 800 480 60 6 0 0 0 

&amp;#x200B;

So I added it, and the screen worked perfectly. Problem is, now, when I plug the Pi into ANY other screen, it forces it into the 800x480 res of the screen, and won't let me make it any other resolution. I deleted that code, and it works fine now, but I can't use the portable screen. Is there anything I can do to be able to use both the portable screen, and other screens, in their normal resolutions? I'm still new to Pi stuff, and haven't been able to find any help."

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi Imager requires admin credentials to run?,"Bit of an odd one, or so it seems. I've installed the Imager for a user who uses this software for some work he's currently doing - straight forward install, required Admin creds which is fine, as do most apps. But the odd part is, once installed, it requires admin creds for each time you want to open the Imager?

I'll state that most users do not have admin privileges on their machines, and I'm not willing to hand it out for some Imaging software... am I missing something? I've tried reinstalling to confirm it's not a problematic install, it does genuinely seem as though the Imager requires them to run. Is there anyway past this? I can't find anything online relating to it, but surely someone's had this issue before?

Thanks for the help in advance!

EDIT: Good bit of the obvious pointing out to me, I would state I know practically nothing about Raspberry Pi or the Imager software myself and this is the first I'm dealing with it - do mind my lack of knowledge!

EDIT 2: No assistance needed, I've been learned'd, non-issue at the end of the day... it is a Friday after all."

When making some test months ago all works well but now, flashing images into the sd and monting on the raspberry returns me some trouble in the wifi connection. Let me explain: If the raspberry doesn't find any internet connection it starts in ap mode. After connecting to him it opens a configuration page where you can select a wifi network and insert the wifi password but now the wifi list is empty and nothing seems to work. I tried to manually insert a wpa\_supplicant.conf and many others solutions but it always starts in ap mode. The problem seems NetworkManager but i'm not sure. Someone can help me?"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi Zero W Access Point - issues running in headless mode,"Hello Reddit Raspberry Pi Community,

I'm seeing a strange issue I could use some help in troubleshooting or next steps.

I followed the main steps of the tutorial here: [https://www.instructables.com/Using-a-Raspberry-PI-Zero-W-As-an-Access-Point-and/](https://www.instructables.com/Using-a-Raspberry-PI-Zero-W-As-an-Access-Point-and/) \- only deviation was that I used the latest BUSTER image from RaspberryPi.org site instead of JESSIE. 

I've configured a Raspberry Pi Zero W to run as a stand alone wireless access point (or AP) for a small collection of devices: an MQTT Broker (built on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+), several MQTT Clients (built on Raspberry Pi 0 Ws) and my smartphone (an iPhone7 Plus). For reference below, the name of the AP's SSID is ""TestWeb"". 

I've ""restricted"" the AP to ONLY allow those devices to connect by including their MAC addresses in the conf file as shown in the tutorial. The devices do NOT connect or communicate to the internet, only with each other.  

When I boot the RPi0W ***with*** a monitor, usb hub+keyboard+mouse attached, everything works perfectly. I can connect the iPhone to the AP via ""TestWeb"" and access the Node-RED interface built onto the Broker to communicate with the Clients!  

Now the issue: I'd like to use the RPi0W as a headless AP with no extra HW dangling off of it. When I remove the monitor, hub, keyboard and mouse, ""TestWeb"" never becomes available. After much experimenting, I've found that ""TestWeb"" will show up and everything will work correctly if I leave ONLY the USB hub and mouse attached. Leaving just the monitor or just the hub and things don't work again. I've tried playing with the various ""HDMI\_SAFE=1"" tags in the /boot/config.txt file but do not see consistent results. 

Bottom line: When the hub and mouse are connected, the AP boots and works fully., when they're not, it doesn't.  Do I need to ""spoof"" devices being connected somehow...?  Any other thoughts...?  Any more details or file/code snippets I can provide...?

Thank you in advance,

Mike"

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/nup05b/2021_jun_7_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,My new P4 heat sink case,"Hi all,

After putting my home network intrusion detection system (NIDS) in production (see my tutorial [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/np1a8f/building_my_home_intrusion_detection_system/)), it soon became apparent that my Pi4 was getting a bit hotter than I would have hoped. In normal operations, under a very moderate 25% CPU load, the CPU temp would quickly reach 65-68 °C (or 149-154 °F). Nothing critical since the Pi4 only starts throttling at 80 °C, but hot enough to regularly trigger the fan which threshold was set at 68 °C.

    Sun 13 Jun 23:14:05 CEST 2021
    temp=66.7'C
    Sun 13 Jun 23:14:16 CEST 2021
    temp=65.7'C
    Sun 13 Jun 23:15:25 CEST 2021
    temp=66.7'C
    Mon 14 Jun 00:11:24 CEST 2021
    temp=66.2'C
    Mon 14 Jun 19:18:11 CEST 2021
    temp=67.6'C
    Mon 14 Jun 19:18:12 CEST 2021
    temp=66.2'C

My initial choice of case was an Argon40 Poly+ with its corresponding Argon40 FanHAT. This setup, despite being good looking and fit for use, proved to be sub-optimal, mostly because of the noise of the fan, even set at a low 5% speed.

I started to look for good passive cooling solutions and decided to go for a massive aluminum case, supposed to work as a big heat sink. I bought a case from Joy-IT for something like $11:

  

[Joy-IT case](https://preview.redd.it/vd8bvq8tea571.jpg?width=1066&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4094eab11ab3034e564ac4be8bd073b74a2e7b9c)

Here is my Pi4 before:

[Argon40 Poly+ and FanHAT](https://preview.redd.it/u81gxbaafa571.jpg?width=1066&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9d98d7da362882412d2f705d3fbbbbd546e5bb4)

And after, with the thermal pads in place. The case has 4 points of contact with the Pi4 board components, and come with 2 full sets of thermal pads:

&amp;#x200B;

[Thermal pads in place](https://preview.redd.it/g9ex99rhfa571.jpg?width=1066&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc18dedf6ba9e1e29185445ddb3a31a3a8f5bb14)

&amp;#x200B;

[Case closed](https://preview.redd.it/l3hwhl3nfa571.jpg?width=1066&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3894f66ce07ee2dc14c0754ff7e1871c89c061c2)

&amp;#x200B;

[Side view](https://preview.redd.it/dngb7m8pfa571.jpg?width=1066&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c384b02b9188602bc9650856cdd27a440bd2468b)

In terms of efficiency, under the same load my Pi4 now runs at between 48 and 51°C (or 118-124 °F). That's an impressive drop of close to 20°C ! 

    Mon 14 Jun 19:18:15 CEST 2021
    temp=49.1'C
    Mon 14 Jun 22:06:37 CEST 2021
    temp=48.7'C
    Mon 14 Jun 22:06:38 CEST 2021
    temp=49.6'C
    Mon 14 Jun 22:06:43 CEST 2021
    temp=50.1'C
    Mon 14 Jun 22:06:46 CEST 2021
    temp=49.6'C
    Mon 14 Jun 22:07:09 CEST 2021
    temp=50.6'C

This is clearly beyond my expectations: I was hoping to see a 7 to 10 degrees drop, but it works way better than I thought. 

I highly recommend this case or any similar case, I have seen several from different brands that have more or less the same design."

raspberry_pi,"Raspberry Pi for YoutubeTv, Netflix, Hulu!","Hello all! I had a post a few weeks ago in r/youtubetv asking if using a raspberry pi to stream youtubetv was plausible and would work and no one had much of an answer so I decided to try it! I wanted to post this on that subreddit but it kept getting removed so I figured here is a good spot!
So first of all it’s a little bit of work to setup and to be able to get it without much headaches you should be at least a little familiar with Linux systems.
So how I set my pi up is I have one of the kits that came with a case and a fan, I use the config.txt file to over click the cpu to 2.1ghz and the graphics card to 750mhz. I then installed the libwidevinecdm0 to enable widevine which allows you to stream video on Netflix, Hulu and other apps along with making YouTube smoother as widevine is an encryption algorithm used for these websites for video transfer and without it you cannot use these sites. Then turned hardware acceleration on in chrome and in the rasping config I set the gpu memory to 128mb. Also make sure you turn off the compensator as well as it’ll help with screen tearing. Lastly with the h264ify extension, make sure it’s enabled and block 60fps video is selected. This will allow you to watch Youtubetv, Netflix, and Hulu on your raspberry pi very smoothly! I picked up a fly mouse remote to use with this and it’s now my main media center for the tv in my living room! I even use WiFi because my access point is right in the next room but if you do this and you have 5ghz WiFi you’ll likely have to edit the wpa_supplicant and force it to connect to 5ghz WiFi. Just wanted to put this info on the internet so if anyone ever wanted to know again, it’s fuckin possible! Good luck everyone!"

raspberry_pi,They have finally arrived.,"So yesterday I recieved the two Raspberry Pis that I had ordered and a nice cluster rack to mount them in. I still have another two to order.

So far I have installed Raspbian on them both and enabled SSH.

The one I am currently working on, I have changed the default user password as it keeps flagging an error message, created my own user account and changed the hostname.

As an Infrastructure engineer who mostly used Windows and Azure, I am finding the command prompt quite easy to work with tbh, exposure to Linux is something I need.

Once I have finished my update, I will be installing Prometheus, so I can start monitoring my devices. I still have more to order. But may as well get some basics setup on one Pi to start with.

No idea what I am going to use my cluster for once it is completed. But just getting some basic monitoring setup for now. 

Also thinking this will be a sweet way to learn about Containers and various other tech."

raspberry_pi,"Installing the real arm64 Debian on Raspberry Pi, but a wild ""debootsrap error"" occrus. What's the issue ?","I'm trying to install the real official arm64 Debian on my Raspbery Pi through this tutorial: https://pete.akeo.ie/2019/07/installing-debian-arm64-on-raspberry-pi.html

The only difference is that I'm using this image instead: https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/debian-10.9.0-arm64-xfce-CD-1.iso

&amp;nbsp;

I followed exactly everything that was said up to the Debian's ""Partition disks"" step, where I saw that my mmcblk0p1 partition was unfortunately detected as Fat even though I specifically told `mkfs.vfat` to use a Fat16 partition with lba and boot flags enabled (0x0e) as the tutorial said.

This is not a big issue since the tutorial showed a workaround for that specific issue. So I then set the mmcblk0p1 partition to ESP and keep up to the ""Install the base system"" step, which completely fails and tells me: ""Debootstrap Error"" ""Failed to determine the codename for the release"".

&amp;nbsp;

So that's my issue: **How do I keep up installing the real arm64 Debian on Raspberry Pi, and fix the ""Debootstrap Error"" ""Failed to determine the codename for the release""?**

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit**: It's solved now. I got the same bug as: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=866629

All you need to do is to get the network on, which in this image case wasn't supposed to happen since it wasn't a netinstall or minimal iso at all. So it's definitely buggy. Hope that this will be fixed for Bullseye."

[RPi4 Controlling and Powering RICOH THETA Z1 with USB cable](https://preview.redd.it/qyxc234kn8471.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=964926f4c05c1a0c83eb92f14dbc0328167d41a8)

Video tutorial on how to use the open source ptpcam to take pictures and download files from consumer cameras with a USB cable.  A major advantage of this setup is that the USB cable can also supply power to the camera.

[https://youtu.be/ZAoH0epvwuc](https://youtu.be/ZAoH0epvwuc)

Although the libptp project is old, [Picture Transport Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Transfer_Protocol) (ptp) is still widely supported on many cameras from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and RICOH.

Another well-known project, gphoto2 also supports ptp.

Although widely supported, usage can be a bit tricky.  For example, ptpcam -L will list the files, but the files are listed by file handles.

https://preview.redd.it/mt46kdb4p8471.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa4aa83b4a317f09f5b0007410c460e297a06e8e

To download the file, you must first grab the file handle and then send another command to delete or download the file.

Example to take picture and delete the last picture from the camera.

[https://gist.github.com/codetricity/0ba87d1261809b35ac4ff23d3a7cf539](https://gist.github.com/codetricity/0ba87d1261809b35ac4ff23d3a7cf539)

https://preview.redd.it/th1qg49jq8471.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7fe1e38218dbfea362f68f766aa7374c757c0f1

In my test, as I am using a 360 camera, I get a 360 image for virtual experiences.  The image is 6720x3360.  This technique will work with DSLR cameras that have higher resolution.  For comparison, the Raspberry Pi High Quality camera is 4056x3040.  The higher resolution is often used on robots and inspection systems to zoom in on objects such as the interior of a construction site.

https://preview.redd.it/phlj60stq8471.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad24c32e3328ae349a410b32f22329e95a94ebd7

In this example, the camera already has two fisheye lenses with greater than 180 degree FOV per lens.  The two images are stitched internally inside the camera.

If you wanted to replicate this with the RPi HQ camera, you would need two cameras, two fisheye lenses of greater than 180 degrees, and stitching software.  For many applications, it is easier to buy a consumer camera that already had the lenses and stitching software inside.

For hobbyists, the camera I used, may be too expensive.  I've also tested this with an SC2 that is less than $300 from the same camera vendor.   

This technique is commonly used with timelapse photography.  Any model of Raspberry Pi should work as there is no image processing on the Pi itself.  Most projects push the images up to the cloud."

raspberry_pi,Enable Chromium sync on latest Chromium version,"So some of you may know that Google removed API keys for sync in the newest versions of Chromium, so I wrote this handy guide to reenable it with a private API key.

1. Go to [https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys) and follow the instructions to join the groups ([https://groups.google.com/u/0/a/chromium.org/g/google-browser-signin-testaccounts?pli=1](https://groups.google.com/u/0/a/chromium.org/g/google-browser-signin-testaccounts?pli=1) and [https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/chromium-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/chromium-dev)) and such in order to enable all APIs with ""chrome"" in their name, and to generate a:

\- API key

\- OAuth client id

\- OAuth client secret

&amp;#x200B;

2. Run

    sudo nano /etc/environment

in terminal then paste in the following:

    GOOGLE_API_KEY=""API_key""
    GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID=""client_id""
    GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET=""client_secret""

Replace all the fields with the credentials you generated.

Run ctrl+x, then press y and enter to exit nano.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Run Chromium and sign in to enable sync!

IMPORTANT NOTE: If this didn't work for you, either google removed further support for API keys and you are from 5 years into the future, or you didn't use the same google account for all the steps. USE THE SAME GOOGLE ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE STEPS!!! If your school account won't let you join a group or make a API key... you are doomed."

raspberry_pi,PoE+ HAT - first batch teething issues?,"Will update as I learn more. So far in my preliminary testing I've found three things I don't like:

1. The surface mount 4-pin PoE header on the underside is still fragile and can separate when you pull off the HAT. This was an issue with the older HAT, and it's easy enough to fix, but sad it wasn't made stronger in this revision.

2. (Filed in the ""how did *that* happen?"" department): one of the 12mm fan screws extends far beyond the bottom of the PoE+ hat and pushes hard against the camera connector. If you tighten the screws all the way, the HAT will flex a bit, putting a decent amount of pressure right on top of the camera connector. Swapping in a 10mm screw fixes the issue.

3. At idle, according to my PoE+ switch, the mew HAT uses almost 2W more than the old HAT (5.9 vs 4.1 on the old.

I've been doing testing on identical Pis with identical setups, and have four PoE+ HATs ordered from 2 vendors... it's not just one bad egg (afaict).

Maybe it's a tradition with the PoE HATs where the first revision has some head-scratching issues."

Point is, that I want VERY powerful calculator, and all calculators that you can buy are a) too expensive b) not powerful or customizable enough. So I decided to build my own. I started selecting some parts. I decided to use e-ink as display, I want it to be touch able, because it makes working with graphs much easier, and I want E-ink because of low power consumption. I searched a lot, and at the end, after some asking on forums, searching a lot, I found this display [GDE060BAFL-T](https://www.e-paper-display.com/products_detail/productId=302.html). (I wasn't able to find anything specifically for raspberry pi), but since I am not good at electronics and I don't understand it much (I am more of programmer) I am not sure I it's possible to work with this display and raspberry pi zero. I really don't understand electronics enough, so, I am not sure, if you can drive this display with raspberry, how can you connect it, and how ?

raspberry_pi,Car Media Server,"So i have been looking at setting up a Media Server for my car, I have 2 kids and currently they watch content on amazon tablets streamed from a Plex server at home with both devices being tethered to my phone. I have 100GB allowance per month and we use this setup about 2 times month some I'm not worried about data allowance but would like to clean this setup up.

My goal would be to have a small media server that stays in the car that services content to both these tablets on a local network, ideally with Plex, but i think the online authentication may mean that cant happen.

My current plan is a Raspberry Pi 4, with a PiJuice HAT to allow for an graceful shutdown when the car power is off (maybe with a 30 minute buffer if connected to my home network to allow it to sync content with a folder on my server).

I was wondering if anyone has any experience with a similar project? the threads I've seen seem to be sparse and old. My skill set here isn't 100% and there are a few things I'm unsure of:  I'd like to manually start the server via a switch connected to Pi as we only need it on occasionally and not every time the engine is started but don't know if this can be done or needs an extra relay etc.

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)^(‡)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

raspberry_pi,Flashing using Etcher &amp; Raspbian Flash Tool creates an unformatted second drive?,"Hello,

I'm really getting frustrated as I don't know whats happening. I've decided to have another play with my Pi4, however I cannot get it to flash correctly.

I start with a FAT32 format drive, which has only the PRIMARY partition on it:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zyeqa7f57v371.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e400bf6d9f3f1e7132c7a504ec2abef37a296c

I then go to balenaEtcher and select my drive/image:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/as3k6fw97v371.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9266d27cf32291b0476fdc1cae3a7d8d0c8d7cd0

Then, it flashes and validates successfully, as soon as its finished however this pops up:

https://preview.redd.it/bqwrsmh12v371.png?width=1133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83a7bf47ba819cc2b574d5fe499a5211e68d39bc

Now the drive seems to have 2 labelled partitions (E &amp; F), E contains the 'BOOT' folder (from the flash) then F contains this unformatted secondary partition? 

I have never had this happen before, this SD card has been used previously for my PI's no problem. 

I've followed a guide to use diskpart.exe to delete all partitions create the primary partition and format. Then flash but the same happens.

I've also used Windows GUI Disk partition tool to do the same. 

However it always results in this corrupted second partition after flashing?

Thanks!!"

raspberry_pi,Rpi0w with USB-Ethernet adapter need trouble shooting ideas,"Happpy Monday everyone. 

I picked up a Smays usb to Ethernet adaptor (not the powered hub version) and I’m having a lot of difficulty getting it to work on my zero W with raspberry pi OS v3.6. 

One method in trying is booting with the adapter &amp; Ethernet cable plugged in before powering on. I do see the pi OS splash screen but it seems to get stuck on some services; so far I’ve seen it get stuck on Alsa-restore.service and dhcpcd.service. 

I’ve also tried booting with just the adapter &amp; no cable and that does get me up and running. Checking with ifconfig, the adapter does get picked up as eth0 but when I plug in an Ethernet cable it’ll pick up an internal (169.whatever) IP address. I’ve tried assigning a static IP via MAC address reservation on my router but that hasn’t helped either unfortunately. 

I did change my power supply as the pi was rebooting when I plugged in the adapter (with or without Ethernet cable). The rebooting issue did resolve but alas no wired network connectivity. 

I suspect the adapter may be faulty and am already waiting on a powered USB hub with networking but I wanted to get any trouble shooting ideas before initiating a return with this one."

raspberry_pi,No HDMI output on monitor,"Hello everyone,  


I purchased an Raspberry pi4b a few weeks ago and I am having issues getting an output signal on my monitor (Acer KG271c , 1920x1080p).      
I can successfully get an image connecting the raspberry to my TV and the HDMI port on my monitor is working since I use it with my PC, so I doubt it's a cable/hardware issue.      
I have gone through countless of posts on the internet and tried every solution that I found, but to no avail. Things I tried so far:      
Tried different cables.     
Tried both micro-Hdmi ports on the pi.     
Tried with a fresh install of Ubuntu insted of Raspbian OS.     
Turn the monitor on first before powering the pi on.     
Disabled auto-source on my monitor and set HDMI as default.     
Edited the following config.txt lines in boot : (not all at once, different combination of settings as recommended in previous threads).     
hdmi\_safe=1.     
hdmi\_force\_hotplug=1.     
hdmi\_group=2.     
hdmi\_mode=87.     
hdmi\_ignore\_edid=0xa5000080.     
I ssh in and used tvservice to turn the display on and off.      


I am really out of ideas and would appreciate if someone can help."

raspberry_pi,Is the Adafruit Stella speaker supposed to sound this awful?,"I just got my Pico up and running for a train crossing gate project. The sound quality is horrible from the test tons I’ve put through it. I chose GP20 and using one of the ground pins for ground and 3V3 system pin for power. This speaker includes the Amp but the sound is horribly distorted. A 440 HZ sound wave plays a lot more than just the 440HZ frequency. A train crossing bell sounds robotic and staticky and hardly recognizable. Do I need to filter the signal for it to sound good? Thanks!

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi Zero W Smartplug,"This is a raspberry pi-powered smartplug I made for a fun project.  I wanted to see if I could make something functionally equivalent to a TPLink HS100 smart plug, and I don't think this is too far off.  The HS100's are nice but while they can be controlled locally with OpenHAB, they are a bit of a pain to set up for local use and they still try to call home randomly.  I wanted something fully local and open source, so I built this with a whole lot of hot glue and soldering.

[Finished project](https://preview.redd.it/5873vbwlkp371.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faa70fdcd0360db3d6c8cd3761fd7beae910b5c9)

For hardware, I used a Raspberry Pi Zero W ($10), a random power cord ($4), a 5V/1A power supply module (5 for $16), a 3.3V relay (6 for $15), and a raspberry pi starter pack with buttons/LEDs/resistors ($8).  I used wires I already had.  The total cost for the prototype was about $58.  Since the relays/power supplies came with &gt;1, if I were to build five the cost per unit would be $27.  

The power supply module powers the pi via GPIO which then powers and drives the relay via GPIO.  The relay sits in the middle of the live AC wire, connected to the NO (normally open) pin on the relay so the plug is off by default until the pi commands it on.  All live AC points are of course very covered in hot glue.

The green LED indicates the state of the relay while the blue LED is (supposed to) indicate the WiFi state, though I couldn't quite get that working correctly. Systemd is not my expertise.

For software, I wrote a few python scripts on Raspbian Lite using RPi.GPIO.  

To make the plug relatively ""easy"" to configure, I created a separate config partition on the SD card.  The pi runs an init script at boot which reads the config partition and copies over WiFi credentials, the hostname, and the public key to use for SSH.  This way you don't have to go searching through root to configure it for a new network.

There is also a button daemon that simply waits for a falling edge on the button's GPIO and then toggles the relay, so you can turn it on/off with the button.  This was actually the most difficult part of the project as I failed to get it sufficiently debounced.  Rpi.GPIO's software debounce mostly solves the problem but does not really work correctly.  Even with a 200ms bounce time I was still seeing the relay sometimes toggle again when releasing the button.  Worse, the button would sometimes think it was physically toggled when the relay was toggled via software.  My guess is that the sudden load of driving the relay was causing a spike on the GPIO line that the pi was reading as input.  To solve that I built an RC circuit with a 0.1uF capacitor, which still did not really solve the issue.  I upped it to 0.5uF and the button still toggles multiple times when physically pressed, though I am no longer seeing the software-triggered GPIO toggle issue.  With a combination of the RC circuit and GPIO debouncing it seems to work ""well enough"".  In the future it probably just needs more capacitance.

Lastly, I wrote a very simple network daemon that takes JSON commands (enable/disable/toggle/read) over a raw network socket.  No authentication or security of any kind, but it's good enough for now for a locally-controlled smartplug.  I usually go off the principle that the local network is not to be trusted, but OpenHAB itself doesn't follow that principle so this doesn't really need to either.  

I might eventually write a binding for OpenHAB but for now you can either a) physically use the button b) SSH into the pi or c) use telnet or netcat to control it over the LAN.

Speakers however are a different matter. I need something compact and simple; but there doesn’t seem to be something as compact and convenient. Easiest seem to be disassembling a mini desktop USB speaker which incorporates the electronics inside the case. But it is still far from compact and convenient.

raspberry_pi,Questions about unpowered USB hub,"I've got a weird situation, and I'm hoping someone can offer me advice. Let me just start out by saying that I'm new to all of this and don't really know my way around the pi or Linux. Please excuse my lack of experience.

I recently setup two identical Pi 4s for use with RetroPie. The first, I gifted to a friend, and the second, I setup for myself a couple months later. In both cases, I upgraded the firmware to the latest before beginning.

I purchased [this unpowered USB hub](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00BWF5U0M/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr) off of Amazon for use with my friend's Pi so that more gamepad receivers could be plugged in. It worked without any issues. However, when I try plugging his hub into my Pi, it absolutely will not work. If I turn my Pi on with the hub plugged in, the receivers will flash a few times and then the LEDs will go dark. If I plug the hub in while the Pi is already powered on, the receivers might turn a solid red for a few seconds as if they're connected to the gamepads, but they're not. It does not matter which of the Pi's USB ports I plug the hub into.

I suspected this might be an issue with my RetroPie install, so I tested this by placing my SD card in my friend's Pi. It turns out that his Pi with my SD card continued to work with the hub!

When I got home, I plugged in another unpowered hub to test it out ([this one](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XBMJ4K5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), which I also got off Amazon). To my amazement, it worked flawlessly.

What could be the reason I'm having this problem with his hub on my Pi? Is there anything specific I should look for in another unpowered hub? I've seen that powered hubs can cause problems with Pis, but I don't need a powered one. I'm thinking of getting something like [this](https://smile.amazon.com/Unitek-Charging-Extension-Connector-Compatible/dp/B07G9CXSW1/ref=sr_1_29?dchild=1&amp;keywords=linux+usb+hub&amp;qid=1622921276&amp;sr=8-29) or [this](https://smile.amazon.com/ORICO-4-Port-Individual-Switches-Windows/dp/B01DBJ3FNU/ref=sr_1_67?dchild=1&amp;keywords=linux+usb+hub&amp;qid=1622921601&amp;sr=8-67).

raspberry_pi,- The Swearing Counter - A Raspberry Pi Pico w/ Pimoroni Unicorn,Recently I picked up a Pi Pico and ordered a Pimoroni Unicorn. My SO suggested to build a Score/Penalty Counter for 2 players. Let’s say to keep track of swearing and calculating the penalty. Button A and X adds one penalty point to Player 1/2 and B/Y substracts one. I took the examples of the Unicorn Pack and other examples around the net as a template.

raspberry_pi,"Stepper motor with A3967 driver not working properly, HELP!","Hello,

Im trying to hook up a 28BYJ-28 5V DC stepper motor with the A3967 easydriver but I just can't get it to work properly.

The motor is moving really slowly and weakly even though it is supposed to have around 800g.cm and it's vibrating like crazy and sounds like a mini jackhammer. Also, the dir pin does not seem to change anything when I set that pin to high/low.

&amp;#x200B;

I have wired the motor up like in this picture:

[\(Except gpio 24 is the step-pin and gpio 23 is the dir-pin\)](https://preview.redd.it/pnak0egg7h371.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f532e8f7c8cf610cafe9179b64aef0628f3f968)

I have also modded the 28BYJ-28 to work in bipolar mode like in this article: [https://ardufocus.com/howto/28byj-48-bipolar-hw-mod/](https://ardufocus.com/howto/28byj-48-bipolar-hw-mod/)

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, heres my code:

    #!/usr/bin/python3
    from signal import pause
    from gpiozero import LED, Button
    import time
    import datetime as dt
    
    mot1 = LED(24)
    mot2 = LED(23)
    
    stepDelay = 0.001
    
    def Cleanup():
        mot1.off()
        mot2.off()
    
    mot1.on()
    
    try:
        for i in range(10000):
            mot1.on()
            time.sleep(stepDelay)
            mot1.off()
            time.sleep(stepDelay)
    
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        Cleanup()
        print(""Ending Program"")

And here's a link to a video of how the motor is currently behaving when I run the code (as well as an overview of my wiring IRL):

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on this problem for two days straight and am starting to give up hope so any help at all is appreciated!

 I  followed a tutorial by Archer in setting up port forwarding.  The Pi does not appear on the DHCP Client List, which the Archer tutorial indicated it would.  I added the Pi to Address Reservation on that same page.  Then, I did port forwarding as instructed.  Nothing.

Oddly, the Pi appeared on my wireless device list when I first added it.  Today, it briefly appeared on the Wired list, even as it is not wired.  Then, it disappeared.  It is suddenly back on wired (still not wired).

Zebra Zero case -Black Ice (w/ GPIO access) by C4Labs

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*How I did it\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I used Imager ([https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)) to flash an 8GB SanDisk Micro SD card with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (x32), then connected the Zero to my monitor/KB to install and configure PiHole using the 1 step automated installer ([https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#one-step-automated-install](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#one-step-automated-install)). After configuring Pi-Hole, I dry-fit the screen onto the Zero and its backlight lit up, then removed the screen and ran the following lines to install the drivers for the screen onto the Zero

cd \~/

git clone [https://github.com/tianyoujian/MZDPI.git](https://github.com/tianyoujian/MZDPI.git)

cd MZDPI/vga

sudo chmod +x mzdpi-vga-autoinstall-online

sudo ./mzdpi-vga-autoinstall-online

sudo reboot

Next I shutdown, removed the micro SD card and fired up the soldering iron and went to town. Originally, I over soldered...ALOT. but it was not too difficult, with steady hands, to clean up. My soldering iron is probably the cheapest you can buy too, so nothing special here. 

After soldering the screen on, I reinserted the SD card into the Zero and boot. Power to the screen is drawn through the Zero and the boot screen displays on the 2.8"" display.

 I havn't installed PADD yet, I'm going to try it, but I ran the following to bring up the PiHole stats on the screen

pihole -c -e

Then I ran the following to adjust the size of the display on the screen. I tried the 1st option on so on until I was happy with the size.

sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

UTF-8

Guess optimal character set

Terminus

12x24 (framebuffer only). you may need to try different ones depending on your screen.

&amp;#x200B;

And boom. Im really happy with it.

It's going to be a long term investment and hopefully a toy for others to connect to and utilize remotely for their own purposes. People could rent the main server for a day with remote access.

250 nodes, or even 1,200 nodes, what can I do to ensure productivity and to max out on my investment? Yes I know about GPU's, computer clusters in my opinion are easier to work with and with the price of an RPi, could be cheaper maintenance wise."

raspberry_pi,Project Tutorial: Firewall with SPI and IPS to separate your IoT devices from the rest of your home network,"Hey y'all. I've creeped through a lot of forums about turning a Raspberry Pi into a firewall, and the biggest challenges seem to be the limited NICs (2x) and architecture. Well, if you're out there determined to turn your rpi into a firewall like I was, I just posted a tutorial:
https://www.hannahtech.co/post/setup-a-home-wifi-firewall-with-ipfire-on-raspberry-pi-3

IPFire is really everything you need in a firewall: SPI, IPS, VPN, etc. The setup in this tutorial is limited to wifi devices, since the ethernet NIC needs to be used to connect to the external network. My intent with this setup is to separate your very unsecure IoT devices from the rest of your home LAN.

You can very easily add an ethernet port by adding a USB ethernet interface (with a switch if you need more than one ethernet port). Tutorial on that will come later 😀"

raspberry_pi,RPi hostname changing for no (obvious) reason on multiple RPis,"A couple of days ago, my attempts to connect to various RPi 3s on my network by their hostname began to fail. They had all been reachable for (literally) years without trouble.  One started working again after I did an `apt update` and `apt full-upgrade`  .  Another one, I noticed, was using a different hostname than the one in hosts &amp; hostname (and assigned in raspi-config of course). It had changed from *broker.local* to *broker-209.local* which I discovered by running `systemctl status avahi-daemon.service` I changed the hosts/hostname entry and rebooted. It came back up with the name I had just given it.  I changed it back and thought all was well.  Not so fast...

The hostname changed again, this time to broker-2.local  I used raspi-config to confirm the hostname and rebooted.  Now it's back -- but for how long?  The one I thought I had fixed with the updates (silly me) has also changed in the last few minutes, also appending a -## to the hostname.

On another, the hostname changed from *octodelta.local* to *octodelta-98.local* for presumably the same reasons.

DHCP service is provided by an AT&amp;T Arris residential gateway and that has not changed is ages.  This appears to be something inside the Pi that is getting off the rails somehow.

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/nkajqa/2021_may_24_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Building my home intrusion detection system (Suricata &amp; ELK on a Pi4),"Hi all,

I have recently completed the installation of my home network intrusion detection system (NIDS) on a Raspberry Pi4 8 GB, and I wanted to share my installation notes with you.

The Pi4 is monitoring my home network that has about 25 IP enabled devices behind a **Unifi Edgerouter 4**. The intrusion detection engine is **Suricata**, then **Logstash** is pushing the Suricata events to **Elasticsearch**, and **Kibana** is used to present it nicely in a Dashboard. To avoid killing the Pi SD-card with read/write, I am mounting a filesystem exposed by my **QNAP NAS via iSCSI** to avoid stressing to much and eventually destroying the Pi micro SD card.

I have been using it for a few days now and it works pretty well. I still need to gradually disable some Suricata rules to narrow down the number of alerts. **The Pi 4 is clearly overpowered for the task**, but on the memory side it’s a different story and more than 3.5 GB of memory is consumed (thank you Java !). The Pi can definitely  handle the load without problem, it’s only getting a bit hot whenever it updates the Suricata rules (I can hear the (awful official cheap) fan spinning for 1 minute or so).

In a nutshell the steps are:

1. Preparation - install needed packages
2. Installation of Suricata
3. Mount the iSCSI filesystem and migrate files to it
4. Installation of Elasticsearch
5. Installation of Kibana
6. Installation of Logstash
7. Checking that everything is up and running
8. Enabling port mirroring on the router

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1 - Preparation**

Setup your Raspberry Pi OS as usual, I recommend choosing the Lite version to avoid unnecessary packages and since the graphical user interface is useless for a NIDS.

Create a simple user and add it to the sudoers group.

Install the following required packages:

    apt-get install python-pip
    apt-get install libnss3-dev
    apt-get install liblz4-dev
    apt-get install libnspr4-dev
    apt-get install libcap-ng-dev
    apt-get install git

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2 - Installation of Suricata**

For this step I highly recommend you to follow the excellent tutorial available here: [https://jufajardini.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/suricata-on-your-raspberry-pi/](https://jufajardini.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/suricata-on-your-raspberry-pi/) or its french original version [https://www.framboise314.fr/detection-dintrusion-ids-avec-suricata-sur-raspberry-pi/](https://www.framboise314.fr/detection-dintrusion-ids-avec-suricata-sur-raspberry-pi/). I am summarizing the main steps below but all the credit goes to the original author **Stéphane Potier.**

First install Suricata. Unfortunately the package available on the Raspberry OS repository is quite old so I have downloaded and installed the latest version.

List of commands (same as in the tutorial from Stéphane):

    sudo apt install libpcre3 libpcre3-dbg libpcre3-dev build-essential libpcap-dev libyaml-0-2 libyaml-dev pkg-config zlib1g zlib1g-dev make libmagic-dev libjansson-dev rustc cargo python-yaml python3-yaml liblua5.1-dev
    wget https://www.openinfosecfoundation.org/download/suricata-6.0.2.tar.gz
    tar -xvf suricata-6.0.2.tar.gz
    cd suricata-6.0.2/
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --enable-nfqueue --enable-lua
    make
    sudo make install
    cd suricata-update/
    sudo python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
    cd ..
    sudo make install-full

At this point edit the Suricata config file to indicate what is the IP block of your home addresses: change HOME\_NET in `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` to whatever is relevant to your network (in my case it’s 192.168.1.0/24).

Also I only want real alerts to trigger events, my goal is not to spy on my spouse and kids, hence in the same configuration I have disabled stats globally and under eve-log I have disabled or commented out all protocols - here you need to adjust to whatever you think is right for you:

    # Global stats configuration
    stats:
        enabled: no
    - eve-log:
        - http:
            enabled: no
        - dns:
            enabled: no
        - tls:
            enabled: no
        - files:
            enabled: no
        - smtp:
            enabled: no
        #- dnp3
        #- ftp
        #- rdp
        #- nfs
        #- smb
        #- tftp
        #- ikev2
        #- dcerpc
        #- krb5
        #- snmp
        #- rfb
        #- sip
        - dhcp:
            enabled: no

Now follow the steps in the tutorial (again [https://jufajardini.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/suricata-on-your-raspberry-pi/](https://jufajardini.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/suricata-on-your-raspberry-pi/)) to make Suricata a full-fledged systemd service and to enable regular log rotations via logrotate (or edit the Suricata configuration file to enable rotations as described here: [https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/output/eve/eve-json-output.html#rotate-log-file](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/output/eve/eve-json-output.html#rotate-log-file)).

You are basically done with Suricata. Simply test it by issuing the following command on the command line `curl 3wzn5p2yiumh7akj.onion` and verify that an alert is logged in the two files `/var/log/suricata/fast.log` and `/var/log/suricata/eve.json`.

**Notes:**

* In case Suricata complains about missing symbols ( `/usr/local/bin/suricata: undefined symbol: htp_config_set_lzma_layers`), simply do: `sudo ldconfig /lib`
* To disable a rule: Add the rule ID in `/etc/suricata/disable.conf` *(the file does not exist on disk by default but Suricata-update will search for it everytime it runs)* then run `sudo suricata-update` and restart the Suricata service.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 3 - Mount the iSCSI filesystem and migrate files to it**

Ok this one is entirely up to you. The bottom line is that storage read and write operations linked to Suricata and Elasticsearch can be relatively intensive, and it is not recommended to run it entirely on the Pi SD-card. SD-card are not meant for intensive I/O and they can fail after a while. Also depending on the amount of logs you choose to collect, the space requirements can grow significantly (Elasticsearch can create crazy amounts of data very very quickly).

In my case I have decided to leverage my QNAP NAS and mount a remote filesystem on the Pi using iSCSI.

Create a iSCSI target using the QNAP storage manager and follow the wizard as explained here: [https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/tutorial/article/how-to-create-and-use-the-iscsi-target-service-on-a-qnap-nas](https://www.qnap.com/en/how-to/tutorial/article/how-to-create-and-use-the-iscsi-target-service-on-a-qnap-nas)

I did not enable any authentication method and I chose a thin provisioning of the space to avoid wasting too much free space.

Once done, back on the Pi. Install and start the isci service:

    sudo apt install open-iscsi
    sudo systemctl start open-iscsi

Let the system “discover” the iSCSI target on the NAS, note/copy the fqdn of the target and attach it to your system:

    sudo iscsiadm --mode discovery --type sendtargets --portal &lt;qnap IP&gt;
    sudo iscsiadm --mode node --targetname &lt;fqdn of the target as returned by the command above&gt; --portal &lt;qnap IP&gt; --login

At this point, run `sudo fidsk -l` and identify the device that has been assigned to the iSCSI target, in my case it was `/dev/sda`. Format the device via the command: `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda`. You can now mount it wherever you want (I chose `/mnt/nas_iscsi`) :

    sudo mount /dev/sda /mnt/nas_iscsi/

Make sure the device is automatically mounted at boot time, run `sudo blkid /dev/sda` and copy the UUID of your device.

Edit the configuration file for the iSCSI target located in `/etc/iscsi/node/&lt;fqdn&gt;/&lt;short name&gt;/default` and change it to read `node.startup = automatic`

Add to `/etc/fstab`:

    UUID=&lt;UUID of your device&gt;  /mnt/nas_iscsi   ext4    defaults,_netdev        0 0

Create a directory for Suricata’s logs `sudo mkdir /mnt/nas_iscsi/suricata_logs`

Stop the Suricata service, edit it’s configuration file `sudo vi /etc/suricata/suricata.yml` and indicate the default log dir:

    default-log-dir: /mnt/nas_iscsi/suricata_logs/

Restart Suricata `sudo systemctl start suricata.service` and check that the Suricata log files are created in the new location.

You’re now done with this.

raspberry_pi,Need help: Trying to run P4wnP1 ALOA on a headless Raspberry Pi Zero v1.3 (with a MacOS),"Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to be asking this, however, I will try none the less.

I recently came across  [RoganDawes P4wnP1 ALOA](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa) on Github and thought it would be a fun little project to try out on my Raspberry pi Zero V1.3 ~~(not W)~~ , however, after flashing the image to the SD card with the help of [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and connecting it to my router so that I can SSH into it.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, when I connect  the Raspberry Pi Zero via directly to the router with an Ethernet cable (Running the normal Raspberry Pi OS) and typed in  `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local` on my terminal, I would get a direct headless connection. — Obviously, I would need to add and modify a few files within boot with the help of some guides, such as: [https://desertbot.io/blog/ssh-into-pi-zero-over-usb](https://desertbot.io/blog/ssh-into-pi-zero-over-usb).

I am doing all this from my Macbook Pro, I have no external monitor, nor do I have an extra keyboard or mouse lying around, so that is why I am doing it all headless.

Getting back on subject: I came across a few guides on how to install P4wnP1 ALOA on a Raspberry Pi Zero:

* [James A. Chambers's guide was pretty helpful](https://jamesachambers.com/kali-linux-p4wnp1-aloa-guide-setup-usage-examples/comment-page-2/?unapproved=11221&amp;moderation-hash=d8e5fc6a1dd7c6f9d0a5490319a55bd8#comment-11221)

However, I came across a minor issue... Once I plug in my Raspberry Pi V1.3 into my router (as I usually do with the [Three Port USB Hub and Ethernet](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/three-port-usb-hub-with-ethernet-and-microb-connector)), I wait a while and try to connect via SSH.

Here's my issue, usually I type in `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`, but with P4wnP1 ALOA running what seems like Kali linux, what should I enter instead?Certain forums have suggested: [ssh root@kali-pi.local](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/64112/macos-not-discovering-raspberry-pi-zero-as-an-usb-ethernet-device) which did not get me anywhere either...

I am not sure where I am going wrong with this now.

PS: I have also tried SSH into it's actual IP address too..."

raspberry_pi,RPi 4K performance issue?,"Haven't bought Pi for very long time, just bought a Pi 4 and planning to setup and give it to my dad to connect TV at home, however I found some performance issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I already moved the boot from SD card to USB HDD, and using an older 2.5"" SSD in USB 3 HDD case (SATA II but still \~180MB/s transfer rate), testing with my FHD monitor seems fine, but connecting to 4K monitor I found a bit sluggish even with RPi OS 64bit.

&amp;#x200B;

First I can't set to 4K60, only 4K30 (already connecting to HDMI port near to USB-C), later I found an issue on github about it recently with FKMS contradicting with 4K60 (tested, get a black screen), so I am just leaving 60Hz aside since my dad is not going to play game with it, video playing more important so I keep FKMS to have HW acceleration.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole UI showing some kind of delay when I am using at 4K resolution, playing YouTube video I can observe some lagging, however I opened up the troubleshooting info on YouTube and found that except first few seconds there might be frame drops during caching, there wasn't much frame drop afterwards, but the screen is still appearing to be lagging. Changed the mouse HID setting in boot command does have little improvement but delay is still observable.

&amp;#x200B;

Connecting it to my 1080p monitor I don't see any of the above mentioned problem, everything smooth, is this the expected performance?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: RPi I am using is 4B w/4GB ram, using bid heat sink case (checked no throttling due to heat), home internet 1G, using ethernet and did a speedtest, I get \~300Mbps upload/download."

raspberry_pi,Tvheadend output on pi zero - anyone have time to help me out?,"My setup: pi zero w with tvhat running tvheadend in the UK (Freeview)

So I've been battling with this for weeks at this point to get streaming working on the pi zero itself,
I've got as far as SD channels are scanned in but no HD (apparently there should be 10 in my area),
I can access them on my phone using tvhclient and play with VLC player as external player and also have recordings setup and epg working.
When I try to access this using VLC on the pi itself it asks for username and password, I enter this and it doesn't play,
I've tried installing Kodi and tvh add-on,
This finds my channels and recordings but when I try to play a channel 19/20 it will just show a blank screen witht he timer going up (sometimes with audio but not all the time and also 5-7/20 it will fully crash Kodi and have to reset pi)
I have already got my mpeg2 license activated aswel, I don't really know any other way to get this to work and I don't know why that 1/20 it will play. 
I even tried using every iptv app and kodi on my Xbox one to see if It would work but none of these worked, they got the channels (apart from Kodi) but same thing black screen when trying to play doesn't matter whether I choose the local m3u file or remote URL it doesn't seem to work.
But works consistently on my phone on various apps, dreamplayer, tvhclient and the other tvhclient app, and also works on VLC on my pc.

If anyone has anytime to help me with this I'd appreciate it very much as it's been weeks at this point and not sure what else to try.
I just want TV in my bedroom  lol
 Thanks

raspberry_pi,USB storage not recognized as storage when inserted after startup,"Hi all!

I've recently begun having a peculiar issue with my Raspberry Pi 4; any USB storage devices I plug in after startup show up fine in `lsusb`, and with zero errors in `journalctl` or `dmesg`, but commands such as `lsblk` and `fdisk -l` just don't recognize them as inserted storage.

Yet when I insert a USB device then reboot, or turn it off, insert the USB, and turn it on, it works fine. As you can imagine, having to reboot to plug in a drive to transfer a few files isn't all too convenient.

And most strangely, when I plug in, say, my iPad via USB, all I/O is perfectly fine, so literally the only issue is with it not recognizing USB drives as valid storage.

`dmesg` log upon insertion:

Now, when a mouse is used to click and drag the GUI works as expected, although when swiping left or right (by tapping and dragging) the GUI interprets this interaction differently.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been researching on this issue for a couple of days now and have tried a number of different solutions of which none has solved the issue. 

These were the most relevant ones and still I couldn't get the touchscreen to behave as expected:

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example of what is happening:

* using a mouse (forgive the clunkiness, I was filming with one hand and clicking and dragging with the other, the overall movement is smooth):

* using the touch screen swipe:

&amp;#x200B;

How can I get the rpi to interpret the swipe motion as click and drag? Any help will be greatly appreciated."

I'm trying to fix an issue with Raspberry Pi 4 4GB. For some reason it works absolutely fine, and then every now and again it's like it gets stuck at low processing power. According to Rpi-monitor the CPU is at some crazy number, while the CPU frequency seems ""stuck"" at 600 or 700 MHz.

I'm using an official power supply, and a 4tb Seagate external HDD. No USB hub, but under heavy load it's never struggled i.e. backing up laptops etc.

On the pi I'm running OMV5, docker &amp; portainer with numerous different containers running. Plex is one of them.

I've got log2ram running, so logs are written to ram and then once an hour it's written to SD card.

I wanted SMART through OMV, but it didn't work initially, I had to do [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=245931). At first, I thought it might be the HDD spinning down which affected it, but I turned it off and it still happened. Then I checked it wasn't the SMART function running on OMV making it fall over, and it didn't line up with that.

 I thought it might be a power issue with the HDD, but nothing in the logs seems to suggest that.

I've been through the logs, and it seems to happen at some point during ""Started Clean php session files"". I've included the logs where it fails here: [https://github.com/Sabb0/rpi-issue](https://github.com/Sabb0/rpi-issue)

raspberry_pi,"Need help, I'm newbie","Hey there!

I'm pretty new to all of this and I need some help with an idea that I got:

I went to a basic raperry pi course a few month ago and in there we made a ""smart mirror"" that showed stuff like the current whether. It's not a lot but I was kinda pround of it.

Now I got a 7 inch raspberry pi touch screen lying around. Since I'm not really using it I wanted to try to make a few things.

1. I wanted to make it work in a similar way like a ""elgato stream deck""
2. And I wanted to try to make it work similar to a lauchpad, just digital.

When googling I didn't find really similar projects so it would be suppper nice if someone could tell me if something like this is even possible and maybe even helping me understand a few things.

Thank you very much for your time!"

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie
* [The Official Raspberry Pi Forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/index.php)

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi with 360 Cameras,"The Raspberry Pi is the most common way for people to use 360 cameras in drones, surveillance projects, autonomous robots, VR timelapse and many other uses.  The video below shows how to set up a Raspberry Pi with open source software to allow the Pi to talk to cameras that support PTP (Picture Transport Protocol) or MTP (Media Transport Protocol) over a USB cable.

[https://youtu.be/2MmEuWz3xeo](https://youtu.be/2MmEuWz3xeo)

Setup is a bit involved as you will need to compile the open source libptp from source, which requires the dev packages for libusb, which can be installed with apt.  The USB port of the Raspberry Pi can supply power to the camera indefinitely.  The same cable that powers the camera is used to send the camera commands.

This same setup can be used to live stream 360 video to the Raspberry Pi and then have the Raspberry Pi relay the live video stream to a VR headset or web browser. 

The system below uses a 360 camera and a Raspberry Pi 4 at depths up to 300m.

&amp;#x200B;

For hobbyists, the robotic kit below can be built for less than $150.  I'm using a RPi 4 for both the robot and camera controller in my build. 

[Cheap robot kit based on RPi 4 for educational experiments with 360 cameras](https://preview.redd.it/zj2i7juwj2171.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba21614ca2bac2d20ef6185e3f12fbc77a4f12aa)

As configuration of the camera controller on the Raspberry Pi is a bit tricky, I documented the steps in a video at the top of this post.   If you use the RPi for telepresence or VR experiences, please share your project.  I am interested.

The problem is that I've yet to come across any projects that seem to fit within anything I'd actually, you know, want in the real world. I've looked at tons and tons and tons of project lists, but they all seem very specific.

* I don't need to control any home gadgets any more than I do (such as LED lights or anything)
* I don't need to be seeing weather/status updates out of the corner of my eye (a magic mirror replicates my phone, for instance)
* I don't need to measure anything - not temp, not sleep cycles, not light levels, not PC metrics, not humidity, not motion sensing - nothing.
* I don't have any IoT devices besides an Alexa and associated lights, nor can I think of any I'd want
* I don't need to be able to access my home network or files from somewhere else
* I'm not that interested in retro gaming, and have a very capable PC otherwise anyway
* I don't have a 3D printer
* I don't need any sort of additional servers (centralized media, mqtt, or teamspeak, for instance) or nodes (Umbrel)
* I don't program at all, and all necessary news is already extremely accessible via emails that I get and my phone
* Just in general, there isn't anything I do every day besides work stuff and the obvious, like brushing teeth or getting dressed or something

My main ""active"" hobbies are cooking (I don't really use recipes all that often, and for those I do use, I have Paprika3), honing nature photography/hiking, and currently studying for the LSAT and getting my pilots license. 

So far I've come across PiHole, which sounds great, although even this is kinda a stretch, as I virtually never see ads anywhere but my phone anyway. Any other beginner ideas?"

raspberry_pi,Rpi4 - over voltage protection - ws2801 led strip,"Hi everyone,

I'm using Rpi4 to power my ws2801 led strip (71 leds). I'm using the 5V output pin and the ground of my raspberry. I connected pin 19 (MOSI) and 23 (SCLK) to control leds. My pi is powered by samsung adaptater (charger) 5V (1,55 amp). And to finish, i use node red to light on/off my leds. It's working very well ! 

I was concerned having not enough current to make it works since many tutoriels recommands to power leds with external DC (and much more current).

I'm a begginer in that field, and i have few -theoritical- questions:

* Is this set-up safe ?
* Is is possible that led strip draw much current that my charger can deliver (1,55amps max) ? Is there a protection against that ?
* Does Rpi4 is protected against over voltage in input ? (like polyfuse for other models ?) 
* Is the 5v ouput pin is protected to or is directly connected to power supply ?

More generally i'm interested in designing safe set-up, feel free to comment :)

Thank you!"

Chrome often gives me ‘page unresponsive’ pop ups, and going anywhere online takes A WHILE. At first I thought it was a sd card issue, and that was partially right. I just bought new microsd cards and that sped things up about 10 fold. Though, my pi is still running almost unusably slow. Are there places I should start looking first? Power supply? Removing software? Etc. my cpu is often at 100% usage, so I was leaning towards checking my power supply. Was hoping someone had tips, thanks!"

The HDMI doesn't display anything, the ethernet port LED's don't turn on and the USB doesn't output any power (I plugged a keyboard in and tried to turn on capslock). The last time I used it, I shut it down using the \`shutdown 0\` command. I have tried different OS installations and none of them work, I also don't have another SD card spare.

Is there a reliable way to make sure it never loses internet access permanently until a knowledgeable human (me) has physical access, e.g. where a bad state can be fixed by unplugging and plugging it back in? The nursing home has WiFi but given the passkey, I think they change it on an annual basis. My only other thought is a cellular modem, the downside being that there's a cost (probably $10/mo to add a line to my plan, on a basic guess) associated with that that doesn't exist with the home's WiFi. Honestly a hybrid solution would be nice if I could ensure that I can always access a remote C&amp;C channel (SSH) through cellular so I could update the passkey even when WiFi is down, but I don't know if I could get a discount/free line for extremely low use data like that. I've only heard of that kind of thing for corporate agreements like Kindle."

raspberry_pi,"PInstrument, modular synthesis on Raspberry Pi","Hi, all. Thought some of you might be interested in this.

[https://github.com/TricksterSam/PInstrument](https://github.com/TricksterSam/PInstrument)  
I've shared my code for my PInstrument, a set of modules for audio synthesis built in Pure Data designed to run on a small touch screen. Specifically, the interface is designed to work on a 320x240 2.8 inch TFT Capacitive Touchscreen but it will work on any larger screen. The PInstrument is also designed to run on a low-power CPU like those in a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4. It was also designed with a 4in/8out DC-coupled interface to be used with a Eurorack synthesizer. As of 2021, Expert Sleepers produces both the ES-8 and ES-9 that will solve these purposes.  
I use it as a rack-mounted touch-screen in conjunction with an ES-8 to add functionality to my Eurorack setup without needing a big laptop on the desk.  
In it you'll find a number of modules:  
Relabi Waves - a four channel chaotic oscillator  
Turing Machine  
Phase Sequence  
Wave Folder  
VCA Panner - panner and four channel mixer  
Quad Cosines  
Clocks - a four channel clock-divider and clock-synced wave generator  
Drums - a quick and dirty set of synth drum sounds  
Pitch Tracker - three channels of pitch tracking for V/O control  
You can certainly run this wherever and however you want. You might even find some of the modules and abstractions useful. Using Eurorack has fundamentally shifted some of my approaches to Pure Data coding and I wanted to see what I could accomplish here. You can run it with Eurorack with Expert Sleepers or just run it stand alone on your computer.  
I believe it's all vanilla Pd. So there shouldn't be any compatibility issues.  
Feel free to fork or get in touch if you want to contribute. This is an evolving project, but I think it's reached a level of maturity that others might benefit. If you want help setting it up to boot from startup on a Raspberry Pi, get in touch.  
Cheers!

raspberry_pi,"Digital Picture Frame Application Stuck, Possibility of Rebuilding with Raspberry Pi?","Hey guys,

Not 100% sure if this is the best place to ask this, but about 6 months ago, I purchased a digital picture frame from Amazon and has since busted to where it will no longer boot up to their pre-loaded software.

I can hold down the reset button to get it to boot into the Android troubleshooting prompt. The device has a USB, Mini USB, SD Card, and wireless capabilities.

The manufacture is some foreign company with no site or support available, so I was curious if there would be a way to still utilize this frame to some extent (instead of just trashing) it by installing a Raspberry Pi OS, or dissembling it and hooking the screen to a Pi board?

I am new to this, so not sure what all options I might have with the device. Hoping there might be something than just trashing it.

Thanks!"
raspberry_pi,"I finally figured out how to stream from Raspberry Pi camera with audio from a USB mic, keep the audio in sync, and encode the video using the hardware encoder.","Pigeons have decided to set up a nest on my balcony, so I decided to stream them. A lot of tutorial on the Internet suggests using ``raspivid`` to output hardware encoded H.264 stream to ``stdout``, and use ``ffmpeg`` to capture a separate audio stream and combine it with the H.264 stream from ``stdin``. However the problem is that the output from ``raspivid`` does not contain timestamp, so the video/audio gradually go out of sync. This was mentioned in [Raspberry Pi forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=222538#p1365602). 

So this is the alternative I came up with: 

    sudo /usr/bin/vcdbg set awb_mode 0
    ffmpeg  -video_size 1280x720 -i /dev/video0 \
            -f alsa -channels 1 -sample_rate 44100 -i hw:1 \
            -vf ""drawtext=text='%{localtime}': x=(w-tw)/2: y=lh: fontcolor=white: fontsize=24"" \
            -af ""volume=15.0"" \
            -c:v h264_omx -b:v 2048k \
            -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
            -map 0:v -map 1:a -f flv ""${URL}/${KEY}"" 

``ffmpeg`` basically takes the video from ``v4l2`` interface, send it to the hardware encoder using OpenMAX Interface Layer. The performance is not as great - the framerate for my setup is only 12 FPS, but at least the audio is in sync. 

The ``vcdbg`` line sets the white balance to greyworld, because my camera can become IR sensitive by turning on the night vision mode. I found the instructions [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1167). 

For reference, previously I use these commands:

    raspivid --nopreview --timeout 0 --width 1280 --height 720 \
           --awb greyworld --metering backlit --exposure backlight --drc high \
           --profile high --level 4.1 --bitrate 2250000\
           --framerate 30 --intra 90 \
           --annotate 4 --annotate ""%Y-%m-%d %X"" \
           --output - | ffmpeg \
           -i -  \
           -f alsa -channels 1 -sample_rate 44100 -itsoffset 10 -i hw:1 \
           -c:v copy -af ""volume=15.0,aresample=async=1"" -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
           -map 0:v -map 1:a -f flv ""${URL}/${KEY}"""

I don't know where else to post this, so here I am. I have been thinking and working on a [Google Drive like clone](https://github.com/syedzayyan/pi-file-server) with a backend written in Go and a frontend in Svelte.

* The UI is still shit :(
* Sometimes large files don't want to upload themselves.....okay it happens a lot.
* No authentication yet. I don't really know how to implement that and how the pi would handle such frequent decryptions.

Yeah.  Also I am using a raspberry pi zero. I don't know why I chose go, I am  still a noob. Svelte because I wanted to work with a light ~~framework~~ compiler that has a smaller footprint. Works almost well. :)."

to stream.  On the Rasp Pi end I receive the errors:

```
On the YouTube end I receive the error:

```
YouTube is not receiving enough video to maintain smooth streaming. As such, viewers will experience buffering.
```

I investigated the raspivid and ffmpeg options and adjusted to what I thought would minimize the processing and bandwidth needs.  However, my settings (e.g.: lower fps and bitrate as well as adding thread_queue_size) did not make a difference.

I am hoping to get advice and gain knowledge on how to improve the streaming experience from the rasp pi to YouTube live stream.  Thank you for any insight."

raspberry_pi,UI options for test equipment,"I'm working on some automatic test equipment using a Pi Zero W. I haven't got around the the UI part of it yet, but I'm exploring different ways to do it and would love some opinions/ideas on this.

I don't want to have a wired monitor or LCD connected to the Pi - the system itself is pretty compact and having an HDMI monitor wouldn't be ideal. The official touchscreens are very expensive, something I'd prefer avoiding. Most importantly, I don't want to have the desktop environment running if possible. My idea at this point is to have an old iPad or Fire tablet connect to the application for the UI. 

1. My primary direction at this time is to have a flask webserver run by my application and the tablet/phone etc. can just use a browser to access the UI. This would be a little complicated for me, but I think I can get it done. It will also need to be a asynchronously updated webpage because the test bench would be starting/stopping based on physical switches and inputs, not necessarily only from the UI inputs (though those will also be an option.
2. IOT cloud services like blynk etc. could be an option.

What are your thoughts? Any other ideas or pointers are much appreciated. Thanks!"

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,No pin presented when connect BLE device using bluez,"Hi,

I have Raspberry Pi Zero W (with Bluez Version 5.58) and tried to connect to a BLE power meter measure device (\[url=[https://www.powerpal.net/\]PowerPal\[/url\]](https://www.powerpal.net/]PowerPal[/url])).

&amp;#x200B;

If I tried to connect the device with my Android, it asks for a pin code; but when I tried to connect it using Raspberry Pi, it disconnects itself right after the initial connection and when I tried to connect it again, it throws a couple of errors.

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting enough, it does not ask for a PIN code; what do you think could have happened here?

raspberry_pi,I can't seem to get interlaced (480i) video working.,"I'm working on a media centre, using LibreELEC, which I can connect to my CRT TV. I have a Pi2SCART, which works pretty darn great in 240p - but because I'm going to be primarily watching films and TV shows, 480i is preferable.

My understanding is that I need to modify hdmi_timings to get a 480i display, but no matter what I put in, I either get a picture very much like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/747180298139074671/842035588524671008/20210512_144844.jpg), or (more often) nothing at all. The closest I've got was [this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/747180298139074671/842038251412914267/20210512_145919.jpg). Both examples flicker/roll up and down the screen, which isn't exactly ideal, either...

I've tried each of the following hdmi_timings lines - 

    hdmi_timings=640 1 80 40 160 480 1 35 5 30 0 0 0 60 1 6400000 1
    hdmi_timings=640 0 30 60 72 480 0 22 5 24 0 0 0 60 1 12800000 1
    hdmi_timings=720 1 80 40 160 480 1 35 5 30 0 0 0 60 1 9600000 1

If I recall, the first of the above gives me absolutely nothing, and the other two give me unusable pictures similar to what I posted. Running tvservice -s shows that each of these run in progressive scan, despite interlaced being set to 1 - I do note that the documentation says not to do anything with that, so I'm guessing it straight up doesn't work, or at least not as intended?

I've also tried

    dpi_group=1
    dpi_mode=6

which produces a 1440x480 video...again, progressive.

Finally, I've tried

    hdmi_cvt=640 480 60 1 1 1
    hdmi_group=2
    hdmi_mode=87

This gave me a 640x480 progressive video. I also tried this with a 720x480 resolution (as 480i is supposed to be, so I've read) and it still gives me 640x480 progressive, indicating that this line isn't being picked up.

SO...after all that, is there something obvious that I'm missing? I admit, I don't entirely know what I'm doing with the hdmi_timings. I've tried a couple of calculators online but they didn't get me very far, either - the timings I've got up there, I've found by searching."

raspberry_pi,"CanSat project, PiZero Remote I/O Error when using i2c sensor and RPIZ-CAM-VF camera","Hey there,  
I am having troubles with my Raspberry Pi setup and would love to get some help.  
I am building the flight computer for a cansat, a can-sized satellite that will fly to a few hundred meters altitude and collect some data and take a video.

I am using a Raspberry Pi zero with a bmp280 sensor (using i2c) and a RPIZ-CAM-VF camera connected to the standard camera port.

Video recording and sensor data collection work perfectly well on their own, but when I try to record a video while the sensor data is being monitored, I get a Remote I/O Error in bus.read\_i2c\_block\_data(addr, REG\_DATA, 8)

The entire error message looks like this:  
Traceback (most recent call last):  
  File ""/home/pi/wise2020/Raspberry Pi/main.py"", line 126, in mpu\_bmp\_thread  
buffer += "","" + bmp280.get\_data() + ""\\n""   
  File ""/home/pi/wise2020/Raspberry Pi/Sensors/bmp280.py"", line 161, in get\_data  
data = readBME280All()  
  File ""/home/pi/wise2020/Raspberry Pi/Sensors/bmp280.py"", line 121, in readBME280All  
data = bus.read\_i2c\_block\_data(addr, REG\_DATA, 8)  
OSError: \[Errno 121\] Remote I/O error

Does the camera use the i2c protocoll? If so, why does that create a problem? I thought i2c can handle a lot more devices. If not, what's the problem?"

I'm experimenting with an SG90 servomotor on the Raspberry Pi, but I don't have a dedicated driver (the servomotor is powered by a separate source). I found this program on google, but I would like the rotational movement of the servo to be smoother, now it is a bit sudden. How would it be solved?

After doing some research, it seems formatting the drives would solve the issue, however both drives are 4 TB drives and are within 400 GB of being full, so I would have to get at least one other drive and spend a lot time transferring files for formatting to be an option. Is there anything else I can do to fix the issue and mount the drives?

raspberry_pi,Trouble accessing Pi," I have a Raspberry Pi NAS in which I can not access the actual Pi anymore. However, I can access the shared folder on my network to access the files. When I try to log in with VNC with the correct password, it just flashes black for a second and then reverts back to login screen. If i enter wrong password, it will say incorrect password. I tried to login in via ssh as well but i get permission denied, try again. I think I might have screwed something up with privileges because I was trying to allow for different computers on the network to access specific directories on the NAS with OMV. The problem was two other computers could access everything on the NAS even though they should have different access privileges and in trying to fix that problem, I believe I might have screwed it up because I cant access the Pi desktop at all.

raspberry_pi,Two HX711s with load cells reporting huge differences," I am adding a second scale to my keg fridge and am starting with two new HX711s and load cells. Each HX711 has 4 load cells in wheat stone bridge configuration. The scale code is capturing the weight data and shows changes when items are placed on the scale. What I can't get past is how vastly different the values are. When I run the code, I get these returns with identical weights on the scale. With identical weights, the ""raw data"" numbers should be much closer to each other.

keg1  
**-155873.0** (this is the raw data)  
keg2  
**-788906.0** (this is the raw data)

All wire lengths are the same between the two scales. Wires between the RPi and the HX711 are about 6 feet of twisted quad (power, gnd, signal pair). The HX711 is wired within inches of the load cells. I have quadruple checked the connections to the HX711s to be correct and identical to the scale I already have in use.   Each of the load cell has the same resistances (1K between red-white/red-black and 2K between black-white)"

raspberry_pi,How To Update Chromium on Debian/Raspbian,"Not sure if this is common knowledge or if I'm just slow at these things, but you can update chromium (and any app for that matter) by running its installation command. So to update chromium (because it really wants to update) just open your terminal and run 

    sudo apt install chromium

and type ""y"" when prompted.

If you have chromium on an application launcher on the panel, an error will occur when trying to launch chromium, to fix this, right click on the panel, go to Panel Applets -&gt; Application Launcher -&gt; Preferences, remove chromium and re-add it using the add(chromium can usually be found in the internet section). Again, not sure if this is helpful, but maybe I'm not the only who couldn't figure it out."

raspberry_pi,2021 May 10 Stickied 𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊 thread - Boot problems? Display problems? Networking problems? Need ideas? Get help with these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"###[Welcome to the r/raspberry_pi Helpdesk and FAQ!](http://f2z.net/RPi-Helpdesk-FAQ.png)

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/n4ain1/2021_may_3_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

I am currently working on a project that requires this feature, but I cant seem to find a tutorial or article that tells how to do this task.

Details:

\-Its a Raspberry Pi 4b

\-The gifs will likely be created in Adobe Photoshop (basic graphic design/short GIFs on replay, and I will need to switch between many GIFs seamlessly)

\- There is no specific LCD display that I am trying to figure this out for.  I am pretty much open to any displays mentioned that would be best fit for this purpose.

\- I would need to achieve this in Python. So libraries or other ways to achieve this would be better fit for my purpose than terminal commands

I can see simple indie games running fairly well on Pi: Celeste, Undertale, Towerfall, Into the Breach, Stardew valley, the list goes on...

raspberry_pi,[Noob Post] Android (ChromeOS) Linux cross-platform?,"I've looked at multiple threads, and forums, etc, but I keep finding that it's nearly impossible to run standard Linux on r-pi, and then overlay chromeOS like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROBpXNonVxc&amp;list=WL&amp;index=2) says, but I wondered if it could still be done on raspberry OS.

I don't currently own an r-pi, but would gladly get one if I could do this, just because of the direct cross-platform. I don't like running VMs because they break easily, and don't work fluidly.

raspberry_pi,Can’t run raspberry pi os on my rpi400 get this error,
raspberry_pi,Can't set pi volume from python script,"New to Pi, Linux, and Python - so I'm probably doing something obviously wrong. I have an Arcade1up running RetroPie on a 3B+. I've updated via raspi-config. My HDMI board doesn't have sound, so I'm using the headphone output and have installed [this power and volume switch mod](https://github.com/orlandovald/arcade1up). Everything is working reasonably well (minus the scratchy audio), but I can't get the volume changing python script to work right. Typing ""amixer set Headphone 75%"" works fine from the terminal. I've tried the following methods of calling the amixer command with the resulting outcome after the #. Thanks in advance for any help!

raspberry_pi,RPI &amp; 3.5in HDD powered through PoE+ hat - possible?,"Hello all, I'm looking into creating a backup device I can connect to my network to back up important data. My idea was a small device that automatically backs up everything upon connecting a single ethernet cable, then sends notification when done. I want it to be unplugged and stored somewhere safe when not used.

My idea is to use a Raspberry Pi (either 3B+ or 4B) with old 3.5in HDD (connected through USB-&gt;SATA), then power it through PoE. I'm wondering, if anyone did something similar and did it work?

My biggest concern is power usage during disk spin-up. My PoE switch (UniFi USW-Lite-8-PoE) is 802.3at PoE+, with max wattage per port at 30W. I found a PoE Hat (UCTRONICS U6102) with both 5V/3A and 12V/2A output (total power 25W). Will this suffice? I have an old Samsung HD103SJ hdd to use, but can't find any info about spin-up power consumption."

raspberry_pi,Trouble with netbooting two Raspberry Pis at the same time,"Hello there,

I am currently working on a project where I need to boot several Raspberry Pis without an SD-card using netboot. At the moment I have two RPi 4 connected to an Intel Nuc which acts as a `dnsmasq-server` and `nfs-server` to serve the filesystems to the Pis. When I boot only one Pi at a time the booting process seems to work fairly quick and the Pi is responsive when opening a ssh connection to it. However, when I boot up both Pis at the same time, one Pi is quicker and boots normally and the other one seems to not get all files, even though it works when only one is booting, and even if the second one boots (about 1/3 of the attempts are successful) it is really slow and laggy. Both Pis are essentially the same, both have 4GB of RAM and were set -up with the same commands. I suspect that the dnsmasq instance I am running is configured poorly (since I am fairly new to this), but I can't find anything on the web which helps me (still searching). 

This is my dnsmasq configuration

    port=0
    dhcp-range=enx00e04c21e798,192.168.1.1,192.168.1.100,255.255.0.0
    dhcp-range=enx00e04c21e69a,192.168.2.1,192.168.2.100,255.255.0.0
    log-dhcp
    enable-tftp
    tftp-root=/tftpboot
    server=8.8.8.8
    server=8.8.4.4
    pxe-service=0,""Raspberry Pi Boot""
    dhcp-ignore=tag:!known
    #dhcp-host=&lt;mac-address&gt;,&lt;ip-address&gt;
    dhcp-host=dc:a6:32:77:2f:ba,192.168.1.3,rpi1 #00
    dhcp-host=dc:a6:32:77:2e:ce,192.168.2.4,rpi2 #00

I included a hostname so that I can differentiate the machines using only the hostname, but even that only works approximately half the time, the other times the default hostname is given to the Pis.

Any hints would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!"

I got a small elegoo uno (like an arduino) kit and have messed around with it while watching some instructional vids on YouTube. 

It's a lot of fun! I have been checking out the raspberry pi lately and it seems that most say it's above and beyond the arduino in terms of what I will learn and get out of it. I know it's more powerful, faster, and is a microprocessor. 

Is it worth me getting one now or will the arduino be able to teach me for a long time until I would look to get a pi?"

I'm planning to buy a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, with the Argon ONE V2 M.2 SATA SSD Raspberry Pi 4 Case. I already have a supported SSD M2 at home.  


I can't find any guide out there, that show how to startup for the first time a Raspberry with a SSD without using any SD card in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I could use the rapsberry imager on my Windows 10 PC, and just target my SSD M2 connected to it (with the usb connector from argon case + usb double male cable).

Then re-plug the SSD to the raspberry, and start it.

&amp;#x200B;

If I can just avoid to buy a SD card + adapter just for 1 or 2 step, that would be nice...

&amp;#x200B;

Can this work ?

After running `vcgencmd bootloader_config`, I noticed that the BOOT\_ORDER variable was still set to 0x1 instead of 0xf41. I tried running `sudo raspi-config` in order to change the boot order options, but raspi-config told me that I didn't have the 03-17-2021 firmware installed, except I just did that.

Do I then decided to run `sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -f /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/beta/pieeprom-2021-03-17.bin` in order to manually install it, but I still get the same issue with raspi-config, and now when I run `vcgencmd bootloader_config`, I get the following output:

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Word Clock with Pi Zero W,"I had an old word clock I liked but it kept lousy time. After getting tired of constantly setting it I decided to convert it to a Raspberry Pi system. Materials required were: Raspberry Pi Zero W, power supply, 28 LEDs, perf board, and Dupont jumper wires. I used all 28 GPIO pins to directly drive white LEDs. 

Software was trivial. It's just a Python program which calls datetime.datetime.now() and lights the corresponding LEDs. The program is started at bootup via cron. I've been tinkering with special effects, such as fading the LEDs. Fading is not working that well since the sleep() function is kind of squirrely.

I'm thinking of making a second try with 3D printed case and better looking LEDs. Maybe even add an audio announcement of the time."

raspberry_pi,I ran into video streaming issues with my Pi 3b+,"Hello,

I'm facing some video streaming issues with Chromium for a while now (like 6 months or so). I'm using the latest version of chromium (the one that comes preinstalled with Raspberry Pi OS) and when I watch a long video/movie, chromium just hangs after ~20 minutes, letting the whole OS freezing. Then It would actually go back to normal after 5 to 10 minutes.

Honestly, I do not know what I've done wrong : I'm using the latest chromium version, running a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS Buster and I even followed a guide regarding DRM-protected content to install the ""Media Edition"" of chromium, but nothing actually seems to solve my issue.

Any help would be appreciated 🙂

If you need more info, please ask in the comments so I can edit my post."

We've got 2 window AC units in the house. My end goal is to use the pi in combination with wifi enabled smart plugs and a wifi thermometer to automatically turn off the AC when the house is at temperature, and turn it on when it's too hot

The script would be something along the lines of if thermostat reads less than or equal to 72 degrees, turn plug one and 2 off. If thermostat reads greater than or equal to 73 degrees, turn plug one and 2 on.

This will be my first project with the pi that involves extra hardware. Just want to make sure the plugs I buy are not locked to alexa or a specific app."

I saw a post somewhere that mentioned that the power supply might not be giving enough power to run the Pi and the drive, so maybe that's it? I'm using the 5.1V 3.0A supply that came with the Pi.

I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to Linux so if anyone can give me some ideas or things to check I'd appreciate it. I thought I included all the relevant logs, but let me know if you want me to include any more."

Now, I have decided to try using a Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB to build a home system (PDF cataloging, LaTeX, Web browsing, etc. no gaming).  I will be running / on a VMNe SSD.  Now, I am trying to understand which would be the better OS choice: RPi OS, RPi OS arm64, or Debian arm64.  I have RPi OS set up already, but would really like to use a 64 bit system to take advantage of the 4B hardware, and am leaning towards Debian just out of habit, but wonder whether it would be better to stay in the RPi universe for better hardware support.  I would love to hear what others are using, and experiences."
raspberry_pi,What are the 2 separate gpio holes for ?,
raspberry_pi,Help with 3V in to gpio,"Hello all, so I’m looking to connect the ringer on a wireless doorbell to my Pi 1B. I have a new multimeter arriving today so I will try to find a source of low voltage that outputs when the doorbell is rung. Probably the speaker output as it’s got exposed pins on a header. 

So if I read all the docs correctly, as long as I take that output voltage and drop it to 3V and less than 16mA I should be able to connect it to a gpio pin and read the pin as high or low when configured as an input pin - sound right?

My ee knowledge is limited to university a million years ago but I’m relatively competent with a breadboard. This doesn’t need to be neat, just functional. 

Thanks,"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 4 as a replacement for Namecheap webshosting for web server and email server,"I pay every year about 30-40 euro for webhosting that I barely use, and I wanted to do some RP4 project since forever. I was thinking of making a web server and email server.

I am sure I can make a single domain server easily, but I have zero experience with multi-domain setups.

**I wish to host at least 2 different domains, possibly also subdomains.**

**I also need an email server for same domains.**

**I guess I also want some cPanel alternative that it is free.**

**And it is important for me that I can, possibly easily, install and set up HTTPS/SSL stuff.**

**What software should I look into?**

**Should I use Raspbian OS or something else? I was thinking Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server.**

I do not care about performance much, there will never be any high load on it. I am talking about website that maybe gets 1-5 visitors per month and even less emails. I just want it to run without issues. Mostly used for some hobby website testing or some photography page.

**Can I load websites from NAS share or does the storage has to be directly connected to Pi?**

**Alternatively, since I still did not get NAS and I am in progress of getting one, I guess I could invest money, instead to buy Pi, into NAS and run server from there. But I kinda want this thing separate, especially because of opening ports and wish to keep NAS strictly local.**

As far as domains go, I suppose I have to set them to Namecheap's free dns server that is used for domains that are not linked to the webhosting dns servers, and change some entries to my IP address, right?

I would appreciate any advice"

You know, like how to get that ""pumping"" effect that's popular on EDM.


I've done a whole bunch of research, and I'm stuck on getting a lightweight solution (something that a linux n00b could handle). Here's what I've looked into so far:
* I checked out Sunvox, but that the Audio Input plugin does not work on a raspberry (at the moment).
* Also Carla is ridiculously complicated.
* Electrosmash's Pedal Pi is currently unavailable, and I don't think it supports two audio inputs (one for the main signal, one to duck the sidechain).
* Blokas' Pisound could work, if I can trigger the sidechain by MIDI... but again there's no obvious software that could allow MIDI-triggered sidechain compression.
* Installing a full DAW like Reaper seems overkill but if that can automagically load a project with audio input and sidechaining preconfigured, I'll do that.
* Maybe there's a way to host a VST inside the raspberry? I can't see a reliable way to do that."

raspberry_pi,What causes deluge upload limit?,"I got a raspberry pi 4b that im using with a seagate expansion 2tb HDD. 

I've tried HDPARM benchmarking and it can reach 125MB/S ""timing buffered disk reads""  


I'm using Deluge 2.0.3 and i never remember Deluge 1.13 being better even though I've tried it for months.

I seed over 100 torrents and a lot of times it can reach 30MiB/s total upload speed, a single torrent had 25MiB/s upload speed. I've sometimes downloaded single torrents with a 30MiB/s download speed but it never reaches past that. 

I often get 20MiB/s total upload from just single 2MiB/s speeds on several torrents at the same time. When a single torrent gets over 10MiB/s and total upload speed is 30MiB/s then it becomes very obvious to me that it should reach higher. The other torrents speed is throttled by the fast speed of the single torrent.

Internet speed is 300MBPS on speedtest-cli and it was near 1GBPS on iperf local speed.

( i still can use raspbian )
#
I searched for it in google and the only thing i found is ""power issue"" that if the amount of ampere isn't enough, it will reboot!

So is it really the power issue or maybe it because of the ""enable_tvout=1""?"

I plugged it in and on the wifi dropdown, it gave me the message ""Wifi country is not set"" I set the country in the config files, through both the preferences drop-down and the wifi dropdown but it hasn't updated. Apparently, this bug has been going on for a quite a while but I have tried everything on the forum and nothing has fixed it.

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 4 for web dev?,"Hey guys, first post here😅

So, I work as a web dev, mostly with Angular and React on the front end, nodeJs with ExpressJs on the backend. I currently have windows but I have been watching videos where one can use the USB-C port on the iPad Pro to power and connect to (via VNC) to the Pi.

By watching this I thought, WHAT IF I get the best Pi model in the market rn and try to work with it, do you guys think the power would be enough so I work comfortably? 

The idea came up since I really love iPads and I’m planning on becoming digital nomad in a near future so portability is a must BUT I don’t like the idea of having a MacBook very much since I would be using my mechanical keyboard and wireless mouse, meaning I wouldn’t need those peripherals existing on the laptop.

What do you guys think? I reas you😁"

I was thrilled when I found out that VSCode had a remote development capability on the Pi 4, for example, but that doesn't work on the Zero (the VSCode remote server doesn't support the ARMv6 chip, as I understand it).

I assumed such a remote development toolset was missing for the Zero, and I find them to be too slow to work on via VNC to a full desktop environment. To my delight, however, Thonny just added this feature late last year. Thank you Thonny developers for building this! I hope other folks find this to be as exciting as I did.

To take advantage of this capability, go to Tools --&gt; Options --&gt; Interpreter, choose ""Remote Python 3 (SSH)"" and enter the SSH credentials for the Pi you want to work remotely on.  You can then open folders and files on your remote Pi Zero (as well as from your local computer) and run them remotely through the Python terminal.  

Thonny's creator has also indicated that future updates may also support accessing the remote system shell through Thonny."

I've been trying to get this right for about 3 days straight and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I am trying to download Volumio to run Spotify, and that's it. I am on my Macbook Pro, using Terminal, and running a headless connection with my Raspberry Pi 3B+ with a 64gb microsd card. Raspbian is downloaded. 

An issue that I'm coming across is trying to establish a SSH connection. After I set up my headless connection to wifi, I have to eject the microsd card from the Pi, and then flash Volumio onto the SD card. From there, I cannot go back to when my Pi is connected if that makes any sense? 

I've made sure my Pi is connected wirelessly by pinging the IP address, which works completely, as well as using Angry IP scanner and checking my router to see if my Pi shows up (which it does.) The address I'm pinging matches up with the ID of the Pi, and the Pi and my Macbook are both connected to the same internet. 

Whenever I try to do ssh pi@&lt;IP ADDRESS&gt;, though, Terminal tells me :

**ssh: connect to host &lt;IP ADDRESS&gt; port 22: Connection refused**

I don't really know where to go from here and I'm getting discouraged since I cannot install the Spotify plugin in Volumio because of this I believe.  I've looked through forums and most of them say that the reasoning behind this error is from 1. wrong IP address, 2. sshd not running on the right IP address, and 3. IPtables blocking your source address of target port

I've tried to see if it's an issue with my Netgear router, but I'm not sure how to diagnose and resolve the problem. If more information is needed to solve this, I'll be happy to provide. I'd appreciate any advice and help. Thanks so much!"

raspberry_pi,[Offer] Custom low-profile tact switch keyboard PCBs,"Hi, I'm about to place my orders and want to know if anyone is interested in going in on the three extra boards I'll receive. I'm not making money on this, I don't have a reflow station and have no use for unassembled boards, but asking the manufacturer to assemble all of them is a bit out of my price range. If you can pay $30 + shipping from Ohio (\~$12 cross country), I'll send you a PCB with assembled SMDs and the necessary components.

Contents are:

* [tactile switches](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/tact-switch-12-12mm-7-3mm-through-hole-spst-no-4-pins.html)
* [USB C connector](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/type-c-usb-3-1-female-test-board-with-pcb-board-24-pins-connector.html)
* printed keycaps
* [silicone cover](https://www.ebay.com/itm/202691732879?var=502801870919) for clarity and printed grid to hold it in place
* 3D models and KiCad files

[Photos of the board.](https://imgur.com/a/LAeVSH5) 158 x 283 mm, running on an ATmega32u4. A printed case would cost an extra $10 or so, I have an Ender 3 which means it would need to be printed in four pieces. I'll test everything prior to payment. Shipping is entirely dependent on the vendors and printing time, but shouldn't take any more than 5 weeks altogether.

Breakdown:

The idea was to make an affordable, low-profile, repairable keyboard. I'll be using my own as an attachment for the laptop I'm building. Regular tact switches are used because they're cheap and easily replaceable. The profile of a macbook was picked so I could print keycaps and use a silicone cover to give it a comfortable look. The USB C port is a separate board that will need to be connected to the terminals, so you can adjust the length of the wire and put it where you need it. The switches do not come soldered to the board, neither does it come with the four M4 machine screws for mounting. I'll flash the firmware if you prefer I do it.  
Please keep in mind that this is an experiment. I will do everything I can to ensure a quality package, but anything outside of the PCB manufacturing itself is of questionable usefulness. I would recommend this to makers and people interested in DIY.

If this interests you, send an offer to my DMs."

A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Question about pi4 and Android,[removed]
raspberry_pi,Webcam works through USB hub and not direct connection," I have an RPi 1 A+, as in I don't have a wifi chip on the board and I only have 1 USB port. To program and test I was using a USB hub with a wifi adapter and the webcam and SSHing into it to get all the work done. I programmed it to, on start up, take the webcam and shoot it off to the monitor, something that a thousand people have done before. My issue is the RPi will only detect the webcam when it's plugged in through the USB hub. It's obviously not a driver issue, as it's not like the USB hub has drivers installed. The USB hub isn't externally powered, so it's not a power supply issue. I really don't know what's going on. Any help would be appreciated. The webcam is an HP Truevision HD that I took out of a laptop and soldered onto a USB cable to use as a USB webcam.

raspberry_pi,USB webcam mic issues,"Hi folks, got an annoying issue here; my webcam mic doesn't work.  I am trying to use a raspberry pi with a webcam and hooked up to the tv as a video conferencing portal. My webcam video works just fine (tested on Google Meet and Zoom) but my audio doesn't. The webcam is not the issue, as it works just fine on my PC. 

I have ensured that the mic is listed and selected on the audio in source in the blue speaker menu. I also made sure chrome could see the mic.

I ran ""arecord -l"" and got the usb webcam name and device listed. So it seems as though the hardware is being detected by the OS. 

I ran the following command and only got static in the test play back:

     arecord -D plughw:1,0 -d 3 test.wav &amp;&amp; aplay test.wav 

I also used the mic testing website and got no audio through the mic. 

Eventually I ran across a suggestion to use ""pimixer"". so I installed it and ran it. I was able to select the webcam mic as an input and adjust the mic gain slider to max (it defaulted to min). The mic now worked. However, its seems that the settings cant be saved. After a few seconds, the gain  sliders reverts back to the minimum setting and the mic no longer works. Neither selecting ""Ok"" nor ""Make Default"" saves the settings. Rebooting doesnt seem to change anything either.   


Any advice on this issue would be greatly appriciated."

raspberry_pi,Pi Zero W 1.1 WLAN Stops Working,"Hi! I have a Pi Zero W 1.1. If I ask it to do anything network-intensive over Wi-Fi, it dies. The Wi-Fi interface just stops working. For example, if I download only very small files, or if I use it as a web server, it works fine. If I attempt to scp a file to it... bam. It dies. It usually takes about 10 or 15 seconds worth of file transfer to die.

Another example is using apt-get. After 2 or 3 tries I can get it to download everything, but it usually takes a couple of attempts.

The Pi itself keeps working just fine, until I reboot it.

I have tried a different USB power adapter (this one provides 2.4 amps), and I've tried a known-good microSD card.

I've also used the latest Raspberry Pi OS release (from moments ago).

Is this a known issue with the Pi Zero W?"

He's got two photos he needs to cycle through and this OS seems like it's easy enough to change photos that the kitchen manager, who is not tech savvy at all, would have no problem changing out the photos when the menu changes. The problem is no matter what button or button combinations I push I cannot get out of the slideshow mode to change any config files. I thought maybe there would be a config file on the boot partition that I am able to see in windows, but the files there do not seem to actually control any of the settings. That or I just don't know which one to look for. Looking at the website it looks like maybe I'm supposed to ssh in and I could try doing that with the OS on my pi3+, but I would prefer to not have to if possible. Honestly I don't know how much of it is me being a little above a novice with not desktop distributions of linux and how much of it is just poor setup documentation that assumes I know what to do to get to things.

I set the sd card up using balenaetcher just the same as I would any Pi OS or linux distro.
I tried using it in my pi3+ to see if maybe that would make a difference, but all it did was boot a little faster.
I tried messing with the config.txt file in the boot folder in windows after I finished flashing the .img file to the sd card. 
Don't know if it's relevent, but one of my flashdrives I tried using the OS didn't like and wouldn't display any pictures from it. It would only show the sample photos.


Any help would be greatly appreciated.

In 'Fixed Time' mode I've tried changing the period and period start times, but it doesn't seem to work. The motion detect never starts 'ca 1'  (I'm just trying to start the motion detect as the 'hello world' test)

It does work when set to 'all day mode'

&amp;#x200B;

Main thing I need is the cam settings.  Can I do this from the command line say via a cron job?"

I've tried archlinux arm and I got stucked trying to compile ffmpeg with mmal support because there is not support for 64 bits os. Also tried Manjaro and raspian with this version of ffmpeg https://github.com/jc-kynesim/rpi-ffmpeg/tree/dev/4.3.1/drm_prime_1

But it didn't work with hevc videos Wich it's allegedly the only codec wich can be played At 4k on this device.

I've been trying for countless hours this whole week. Supposedly the LibreElec guys got it working but I couldn't replicate it.

Basically I need mpv to play these abides as I'm able to control playback with scripting this way. 

Any help will be much appreciated."

The IR Remote has been hard to find and missed in my initial review of the M.2 case as it was unavailable everywhere I looked.  But, it's now added to the page with a scan of the original manual and I re-typed portions of it (with some corrections) to make it easier.

raspberry_pi,Bluetooth headphones multiple source same audio,"This is a stupid question that my brain wants answers and I figured rpi would know

For a home system can you have two or more Pi broadcast as the same Bluetooth device in sync and broadcast a song or stream I guess it would be in a way that does not require re pairing with a stutter to run of the mill bluetooth headphones

Effectively signal mirroring to form something similar to a mesh network using Bluetooth

I was thinking along the lines of if this could be connected to multiple headphones and you have a home control system that plays everybody’s individual audio you could walk away from the device hundreds of metres away if you truly wanted to and got the system set up there

This is just an idea that popped into my head the practicality of it is probably moot"

What would you do in my situation.  Just leave the onboard wifi  running and try my other options?  Seems like a conflict would occur and  cause misinformation on wifi speeds.

For building 4.19.71-rt24-v71 for a Raspberry Pi, however, I followed a procedure that cross-compiled the kernel to .img files. I've put the process below, for reference.

I'm now trying to build a fork of Etherlab EtherCAT master I found that has instructions for building for ARM/raspberry-pi.... except for rt\_preempt. To build Etherlab, I need the linux sources, which aren't on the raspberry pi running the rt\_preempt kernel I built. The Etherlab make file doesn't seem to support cross-compilation, so I'm planning to build it on the pi itself.

I don't normally have to delve too deeply into where kernel source packages come from. I patched a linux directory on my machine. Are the linux kernel sources just that entire directory, and tar them up and copy over to the target machine, or are they a sub-directory of that folder?

I know it's a stupid question, but I've been spoiled by building the kernel targeting full Ubuntu PC's and this is a tad outside my wheelhouse.

Thanks again.

RPi Kernel build method follows:

\------

 \`\`\`

$ cd linux 

$ git checkout rpi-4.19.y-rt 

Branch 'rpi-4.19.y-rt' set up to track remote branch 'rpi-4.19.y-rt' from 'origin'. 

Switched to a new branch 'rpi-4.19.y-rt' 

&amp;#x200B;

$ export ARCH=arm 

$ export CROSS\_COMPILE=\~/rpi-kernel/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf- 

$ export INSTALL\_MOD\_PATH=\~/rpi-kernel/rt-kernel 

$ export INSTALL\_DTBS\_PATH=\~/rpi-kernel/rt-kernel 

$ export KERNEL=kernel7 

$ cd \~/rpi-kernel/linux/ 

$ make bcm2711\_defconfig 

$ make -j$(nproc) zImage  

$ make -j$(nproc) modules  

$ make -j$(nproc) dtbs  

$ make -j$(nproc) modules\_install  

$ make -j$(nproc) dtbs\_install 

Next, make a blob of data at the end of the kernel image typing: 

$ mkdir $INSTALL\_MOD\_PATH/boot 

$ ./scripts/mkknlimg ./arch/arm/boot/zImage $INSTALL\_MOD\_PATH/boot/$KERNEL.img 

$ cd $INSTALL\_MOD\_PATH/boot 

$ mv $KERNEL.img kernel7\_rt.img 

Transfer the Kernel 

After the compilation is completed, compress all files to transfer them to the Raspberry Pi: 

$ cd $INSTALL\_MOD\_PATH 

$ tar czf ../rt-kernel.tgz \* 

&amp;#x200B;

Transfer over to RPi

 

Installing the Kernel Image, Modules &amp; Device Tree Overlays 

\~$ cd /tmp 

/tmp$ tar xzf rt-kernel.tgz 

/tmp$ cd boot 

/tmp/boot$ sudo cp -rd \* /boot/ 

/tmp/boot$ cd ../lib 

/tmp/lib$ sudo cp -dr \* /lib/ 

/tmp/lib$ cd ../overlays 

/tmp/overlays$ sudo cp -d \* /boot/overlays/ 

/tmp/overlays$ cd .. 

/tmp$ sudo cp -d bcm\* /boot/ 

Add the following entry to the end  /boot/config.txt: 

\# Boot RT kernel 

kernel=kernel7\_rt.img

raspberry_pi,Pimoroni Scroll PHat HD always gives remote I/O error,"Hi, everyone.

I have a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a Pimoroni Scroll PHat HD.  I have the Scroll PHat soldered on pins 2, 3, 5, 9, 39 and 40 (for stability of the header).

I admit that I may not be the best solderer in the world, but the pins look pretty good to me.

I have tried this same PHat on 2 different RPi 3B+s with the same result.

I have installed all the software using the Pimoroni dashboard and am just trying to get a pixel to light up on Python.  Every time, I get Remote I/O error.

1. Do I need to solder all 40 pins?  (https://pinout.xyz/pinout/scroll_phat_hd implies that I only need the pins I've soldered).

2. I ran i2cdetect and got all dashes.  (OK, the first 3 positions were blank and then all dashes.)

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

I looked into LibreELEC and it seems promising but it appears that I can't install any additional software on it. The additional software in my case will be mostly PiHole and some of my own python + shell scripts (nothing too graphics intensive, just some command line tools for system admin etc)

  


It also seems like 32 bit Raspian has HW acceleration but I'd really love 64 bit one

  


Do ALARM/Manjaro/Ubuntu have this ?

  


Any other alternatives I'm not aware of ? Or I'll have to compulsory give away 64 bit support for hardware acceleration

  


On other hand, is hardware acceleration on the supposedly working OS (raspian 32 bit) really that good ? I mean can it play 1080p60 local videos witjout any issues ? How high can the resolution go with HW acceleration ?"

I have my first Raspberry Pi showing up in the mail today. I had ordered it so I could refit a robot of mine from a few weeks ago, and so I could apply it to future projects once that was done (I'm a high school student who can't get a job with COVID so I don't really have any source of robotics money and could only afford one). I was only able to purchase one regulated power supply. I can, of course, fit something to the 5v micro USB standard, but I have an 18v pack onboard that runs a motor controller, and it used to run an Arduino Uno as well. My question is - could I run the Raspi off of the same battery set as the motor controller, just subbing in a pi with a spliced cable to run off of my pack for the Arduino, or do I have to supply a steady 5v to the board. If it matters at all, the pi is going to be running 5 GPI/O pins, 2 for the left motor, 2 for the right motor, and one for a horn. Any voltage restrictions, or will I be fine to run it from the same grid? I couldn't find anything preexisting online"

raspberry_pi,Having trouble with a 800x480 display built for Raspberry Pi,"Context: ""Recently I bought a 5inch 800x480pixel HDMI display to use with AIDA64 as a sensor panel to monitor temperatures and FPS. Now, whenever I try to play a game which puts my GPU under stress, it causes a randomly flickering black screen which will pop up every couple of minutes. It is meant for Raspberry PI but works perfectly as a computer monitor as long as I'm not playing an intensive game. I have narrowed this mini display down to be the problem, as this black flickering does not happen when I have it unplugged, and it had never occurred before I got this display. They offer drivers which supposedly fix this problem, but they are drivers for Raspberry PI only.""

A user on r/computerhelp suggested a possible solution would be for a raspberry pi to run the display, then connect the display to my PC somehow. No idea if this is actually possible, but I figured this would be the best place to inquire. Any help is greatly appreciated!

raspberry_pi,Any way to increase Samba transfer speeds without using ethernet?,"I have both my laptop and my Raspberry Pi connected to the network via WiFi, when running transfers I only get about 1.8 MB/s. Now obviously I am aware using a Gigabit ethernet cable should give me up to *at least* 100 MB/s transfer speeds. The problem is that I live with roommates and they think that connecting devices to the router via ethernet will tremendously decrease everyone else's connection so that is out of the connection. All I can really do is switch between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connections, my Pi is pretty far from the router so I usually just use the 2.4 GHz. 

Should I invest in a WiFi adapter? I generally only get like 4-60 MB/s download speeds through the internet, I figure the Pi's network interface probably just isn't that amazing. I have Comcast, we pay for 200 MB/s down.

Let me know what you guys think! I will be moving out at the end of July and I will have a lot more freedom over networking things, but for now, I'm just trying to improve what I can, however, I can."

raspberry_pi,Is my new Pi 4 bricked? What can I try?,"Hello there,

today I got my new Raspberry Pi 4 and after starting off with a fresh image of Raspberry Pi OS, I was happy to use it over ssh (as I do not have the proper HDMI adaptor). Everything worked fine.

I started to encode some videos using ffmpeg and monitored the CPU-usage using htop simultaneously. The usage did not exceed \~35% on any of the cores. After about 10 minutes both ssh connections dropped out and I went to check on the Pi. Neither the activity-LED nor the LAN-LEDs were on and the small heatsink on the chip was hot. So I turned the Pi off, waited 10 minutes for it to cool down and tried to boot.

The Power-LED was on, no other LED turned on and the chip began to run hot again (with no activity).

So I tried the following with no success:

* removing the SD card (still works fine when plugged into a computer)
* inserting another SD card with a fresh image
* tried different USB-C cables
* tried different power-supplies

In the middle of this the behavior changed, now the power-LED blinks (as if the power-supply drops out). When powering the Pi from a Windows-Computer I get the warning that the USB-Device draws too much power. Is my Pi shorted/bricked? What can I try?  
Thank you!"

Using a raspberry pi, screen, mouse, keyboard, a barcode scanner, and some simply Python, I've set up a light-weight record system to keep track of who owes what to the common box. It works like this for any resident:

1. Go to own account
2. Type in how many items you want
3. Scan the barcode of the given item

The quantity and price is then recorded into an excel-sheet using openpyxl. At the start of each month I bill every resident their owed amount. However, no backup is taken of the records, and a week ago we had a fatal error that forced me to wipe the pi's SD card and reset the system completely, losing all records in the process. Since then I've been looking into uploading the excel-files periodically to a cloud-service (Onedrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.), but all solutions seem to be unnecessarily convoluted, and I care more about ease of implementation than elegance. 

Any advice on how to do this would be much appreciated. I am open to any suggestion, doesn't have to be cloud-based, just low-maintenance and automatic."

How do I verify that this raspberry pi 4 b is defective? Ot have I already?

Possibly too much context:
I just bought a pi 4 b, it will not connect to any bluetooth device. I've tried a speaker, mouse, keyboard, and android devices. I've tried fresh copies of raspian and twisterOS repeatedly. Solder on the wireless chip does look a bit dodgy. Wi-Fi works consistently. Everything else works fine. 

 It was a real pain to remove this from my argon one case for troubleshooting. I ran it with only a power cable on the naked board, using vnc. It will not see bluetooth devices ~50% of the time when I boot. The other ~50% it will see devices, give me a pin to type if its a keyboard, then timeout when attempting to pair, as though its failing to transmit. I have been writing with rpi-mager from a rpi 3b and this pi 4b from images and with the built in rpi-imager downloads. I'm using known good Samsung and SanDisk SDs.

I am in contact with cannakit, from whom I purchased the 8gb pi 4 b board with the power source."

Also, the quality isn't great - I wasn't expecting 1080P, but I also wasn't excepting this big of a difference from the official camera.

raspberry_pi,Safety Dojo Activity - 6-Inch Proximity Sensing - HELP!!,"  

Greetings, I am a health and safety professional in a manufacturing environment. 

Hoping someone could help me with an idea I have for a safety dojo activity at my company. A safety dojo is a training area that helps emphasize safety principles, allowing employees to practice the safety principle without experiencing real-world consequences. 

We have a rule at our company when it comes to using hand powered tools; The 6-Inch Rule. All employees must keep their hands at least 6-Inches from the business end of the tool (drill, rivet gun, monobolt gun, etc…).

I initially envisioned something like the board game Operation. Idea was to have a simple circuit with one end of the circuit connected to a 12” diameter metal cone/shroud around the end of an inert drill (could use the case of a broken cordless drill or a toy black &amp; decker drill) and the other end of the circuit connected to a glove. 

Anytime the user’s gloved hand crosses within 6” of the end of the inert drill and contacts the metal cone/shroud, a buzzer and light would be activated on the inert drill. We would have the user perform some series of activities that would challenge them to keep their free hand 6-inches from the end of the drill. Attached is a rudimentary illustration of this idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Simple circuit based off the board game \\""Operation\\""](https://preview.redd.it/aogjjm0w7zr61.jpg?width=781&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17a2eead603f58d61b5fdf99f080404c01b03857)

I pitched this idea to our tool engineer and he recommended looking into some sort of RFID device that could be calibrated to trigger an alarm/light when it is within 6-inches of the tag. I have been researching how to accomplish this using an Arduino or raspberry pi. 

Thought I would make a post, asking the experts and potentially offer up compensation to someone willing to help me create this tool."

I definitely want to fit this picture frame together with either a raspberry pi 4 or a raspberry pi zero W, (both of which I have) so that it can just be a stand alone picture frame monitor/pi w WiFi and Bluetooth. But I don’t really know too much about electronics like this. I’m on a mission to learn.

It does look relatively simple. From what I see, it looks like it just has power (red), ground (black), and then the ribbon cable which attaches to an adapter, and then to the rest of the electronics. I assume this is just used to get the image to the screen.

I bought [this adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3552?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxrTs0ZLu7wIVfj6tBh1R4Q_hEAQYASABEgLVpfD_BwE) from Adafruit in hopes that It might make the job easier to put the whole thing together w the Pi Zero, but I know it’s just a shot in the dark and it most likely is not even the right part to make this build work.

If anyone has any insight on how I can move forward with this, or if it’s even possible, please fill me in! Thanks!

raspberry_pi,[RPi4b - GPIO] Pin 11 (GPIO 17) does not provide enough or as much power as pin 1 (3v3 power).,"I'm trying to write a small python script to control a mini fan on my pi. My fan originally was setup with power from pin 1 ^((3v3 power)) and grounded at pin 6 ^((ground)). When I changed the power cable to pin 11 ^((GPIO 17)) and set the output to `GPIO.HIGH` the fan makes an *electric chirping* noise and either doesn't spin or spins slower.  
It looks like (my speculation) that it's not getting enough juice and is thus making this noise since it's struggling to rotate the fan.

I've connected the pins correctly as it is switching between power on and off in a specific interval that I've setup for testing.  
My simple script (in case I'm doing something wrong):

    import time
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
    
    GPIO.setup(PIN, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)

raspberry_pi,RPi4 Bluetooth stopped working,"I created this [post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=308821&amp;p=1846999#p1846999) in the Raspberry Pi Forum.

I am using a **Raspberry Pi 4** (Linux raspberrypi 5.10.17-v7l+) with **Raspbian OS** as a ""Jukebox"" that connects to my home speakers via Bluetooth. Yesterday I noticed that one of my speakers was not connecting, so I decided to run `sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade` to rule out any dependency issues.

After running the updates, my Bluetooth Applet disappeared from my task bar. Bluetooth capabilities seemed to disappear altogether.

Now I have to manually run  `sudo modprobe btusb &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service` to start bluetooth, however when I try to scan for bluetooth devices, I get the following error:  


    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo bluetoothctl
    Agent registered
    [bluetooth]# scan on
    No default controller available

I installed `blueman` however when I try to connect a new device, it shows me a ""No adapters found"" error.

This is only happening on my RPi 4. I was testing the same process on my RPi 3 B and Bluetooth seems to be working even with a fresh install. 

TL;DR - My default bluetooth stopped working on my RPi4 after I ran `sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade` and now I can't get bluetooth to work even after re-imaging the card.

Any insight or help is much appreciated!"

raspberry_pi,Problem with nucleo rasberry connection.,"School task: Compose a program in STM32 nucleo which every 3 seconds sends a random value between 1-30 to Raspberry via USB port. In Raspberry you can use for example python script which receives the random value and print it on the screen.

Using mbed we made a code:

#include ""mbed.h""

int main()


{

    while(true)

    {
        srand (time(NULL));
        printf(""%i\n"",rand()%30);
        wait_us (3000000);
    }
}

and uploaded it to nucleo, then we connected the nucleo to Rasberry pi 4 via usb. In the rasberry we ran the following code:

#!/usr/bin/env python 

import serial 

 

ser = serial.Serial( 

      port='/dev/ttyACM0', 

      baudrate = 9600 

) 

while 1: 

      try: 

            num = ser.read() 

            print(ord(num)) 

      except: 

            print(""An exception occurred"")

Only problem is that instead of giving us 1 random number between 1 and 30, its giving us 4 random numbers and the first value is over 30

raspberry_pi,Working with 120/240v mains .. you will not die just yet,"On a different thread, I made the ""mistake"" of mentioning the possibility of building your own power supply and people freaked out that this kind of activity would kill hobbyists. People who freak out about working with mains but easily plug in any cheap Chinese charger and leave it under a desk to gather dust for a year …. just does not make any sense to me. I would rather use my home-built power supply than that kind of negligence.

Because of this freakout, it seemed to me to be the time to lay out some sanity and some basic rules for working with mains voltages. 

I am an experienced hobbyist, been around before the digital period and worked on tons of analogue projects that always required me to build my own power supply. One of my current hobbies is renovating old tube radios, where 300v+ is the norm. I have had my share of sharp zaps, and learned from them. In fact, a 30v/10A variable power supply is a must for any hobbyist. I have built my own years ago (of course) but they are cheap on Amazon.

***First of all, if you are working on a project while it is still plugged into the mains then you are a bag of bricks trying to win a Darwin prize. You should also have someone help you cross the road because you are obviously not fit to take care of yourself. UNPLUG!!!!!.***

Basic science people; 300V will not kill you, but 100mA just might. The more resistance in the conducting path (you) to the ground the better, that is the baseline for my workbench:

\#1 All of the power outlets on my workbench are earthed with double-pole switches and a bright red neon light that tells me that the outlet is powered up. It saves me from unplugging every time, provides a good visual clue but even then, out of habit, I unplug most times anything I am working on and not testing. Btw, the earth wire is not switched, that is a constant connection. If you are really serious you can add a main cut-out switch that depowers everything on the bench. 

\#2 My workbench is wooden, with no metal to be found. I have glued a couple of silicon placemats from Ikea on my work area: non-slip, heat resistant (soldering!) and non conducting.

\#3 My chair has plastic wheels rolling on yet another thing from Ikea, a plastic desk chair mat.

Overkill all of this together? Yes, but I have a BS in electrical engineering, trained in 10kV and 100kV and there is no such thing as being overprotective for me. But, it is a bit of overkill. I do recommend at least a wooden surface and that Ikea placemat, that will help regardless if you are working on mains or not. A piece of triplex, two wooden slats underneath, that mat glued on, and bingo, you are good to go. Also helps with soldering, I ruined too many tables to make that mistake again.

When I get an old radio to renovate or someone drops an amplifier by that does not work I perform the following steps:

1. DO NOT PLUG IN, NEVER!! You can do a lot of damage without performing the steps below first.
2. Remove the power cord, which will be replaced by a new one … always. Factory-made power cords are often flimsy and cheap, and after a few years, they degrade. Replace.
3. Measure the resistance over the mains connection directly at the transformer, should not be zero. If zero, give it back or use it for spares. A burned-out power transformer is almost impossible to replace and very dangerous.
4. Move back now to the fuse. If no fuse then I will add one to the power rail. If the fuse is blown then red flag, danger Will Robinson, fuses do not just blow. Tread carefully
5. Check the power switch, use some contact spray and some WD40 to lube it up to make sure it does not pull a spark when switching. If dubious then replace, always. 
6. Rig up the new power cord, use a thick 3 wire cord and a solid earthed plug. If what I am working on is not earthed (not uncommon in old tube related stuff) then I run the earth wire up to the chassis.
7. Measure over the pins of the plug before plugging in for the first time, should not be zero, should be about the same as with step 3. If zero, then you made a mistake, start over. I have a dim-bulb set up for powering up the first time (Google that), very easy to make and it protects you and the equipment you are testing.

Now you know you are safe on the power side of the transformer. 

If you are building your own power supply use the same method. Do not skimp with cheap plugs or wire that looks “prettier”. Overengineering on the 120/240 side of your power unit is always a good thing.

You should respect mains power 120/240/360, but not fear it. If you take simple precautions (UNPLUG!!), use good components, have everything fused, then there is no reason you should fear it.

Have fun.

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/mg2hrs/2021_mar_29_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Chromium OS and GPIO,"So I'm working on a Cyberdeck/Wearable system and I'm shifting focus slightly from mobile computing to Combat Systems/eSport.

Let me explain.

I play paintball, when I can, when is rarely as an adult... Anyway a group of players have developed several apps for larger games. Trick is they're developed in Unity to run on Android and IOS and I can't blame them for that because those platforms are more accessible.

So there's the rub. The platform I'm building relies of physical interface using the GPIO (think pipboy) which isn't an issue for Linux builds on pi, but I haven't dabbled in Chromium yet. How much access does Chromium OS have to the GPIOs? Am I better off trying to get their Unity apps to run on Linux or am I screwed in general?

Their platform is open one hangup is that they seem to release an app per event. I haven't gotten my hands on their app yet but long term I don't see them developing in Linux. If the app is simple and connects to an open server then I probably could just build my own Linux version to ""talk"" with theirs but that might be over my head right now since I'm still developing the hardware.

Help a noob."
raspberry_pi,Web developer interested in programmable bike LEDs with a few beginner questions.,"I've been trying to learn how to make animations with LED strips for my bike and other mobile LED projects. The more I research, the more I realize I don't know and need to study. I’m a web developer with a decent amount of python + javascript experience so the actual code side of it doesn’t seem so bad. But the electrical side of things feels a bit intimidating.

I guess I was hoping there would be a simple-ish path to create programmable LED strips or matrices. But it feels like the more I dive into tutorials, the more I need to know about various electrical things. There isn’t like a lego-like plug-and-play way to wire something up like this. In the web development world, you can build a site from scratch using HTML/CSS/JS, or use something like React as a framework...but a lesser-technical person can also use something like wordpress which will enable them to make a common web page without having to understand as much of the underlying complexity. But it doesn't seem like the Arduino/Raspberry PI LED projects are like this. It seems like I’ll need to get a breadboard, learn about capacitors/resisters, get a soldering iron, get a multi-meter, and generally dive into many different tutorials before I can make programmable led strips for my bike.

Is this generally right? Or am I overestimating the learning curve? How would you recommend approaching this? Is there a wordpress-equivalent for LED programming?"

I tried booting with 5v USB, moved the ethernet to a non-PoE switch and it booted, eth0 was up and running.

On a whim, I moved the ethernet cord to the PoE switch and it continued to work, even when I removed the USB power.  

Now, after all that, I can power it with PoE and eth0 is up and running.  Is this a normal situation with the PoE hat?

Everything was working fine, but now I'm upgrading to a Pi4 and want to start from scratch and rebuild the OS.

If I delete the sda1/2 partitions and apply the latest OS image, will that 'just work' -- and the 'expansion' that happens in first boot will only expand up to the starting point of sda3? Or will that overwrite all the partition data and SDA3 would be lost?

I'm hoping there's a way to do this without another hard drive or loss of data on the third partition -- but I'm not sure what the right way to tackle that is.  Ideas?"

raspberry_pi,Installing kernel headers for previous kernel versions,"Hi there,

I am working with a RPI4B 2GB, on which I've install Raspberry OS. 

Due to a specific issue, I've had to downgrade my kernel version  to 4.19.118-v7l, using `sudo rpi-update e1050e94821a70b2e4c72b318d6c6c968552e9a2`. 

In doing so, I broke my wireguard install, or at least the part of it that relied on the kernel headers. At present, it seems like the kernel is properly downgraded, but I can't manage to install the corresponding kernel headers to get wireguard to work again.

I tried
`sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers`, which results in

&gt; Reading state information... Done

&gt; raspberrypi-kernel-headers is already the newest version (1.20210303-1).

&gt; 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded

`sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers-4.19.118-v7l`, however, results in

The only ""all"" linux-header I get is for kernel v.4.9.0-6. I'm not sure it would be wise to downgrade the kernel that far back just to get the headers...

Would anyone have a suggestion to downgrade the kernel headers to match the kernel version currently installed?

raspberry_pi,Multiple crontab jobs at the same time,"I have a RPi monitoring my keg fridge.  It is monitoring the CO2 pressure, the temperature inside the fridge, and an HX711 load cell scale (quantity based on weight).  Currently, each sensor is running on its own python script.  One is on a 3 minute looping script that starts on boot, one is on a crontab schedule to run every 5 minutes, and another runs on demand (initiated by a push button).  For monitoring the sensors, the python scripts send a message to my phone with the variables (pressure, temperature, and the raw data from the scale).  Tasker (Android app) will interpret the variables and display the information either on my home screen, in a notification, or in a screen that I can pull up with one or two taps.

Sure eventually I need to combine them all in one script, but for now I need to test each element to see if Tasker has issues processing the three messages so close together (should be fine).  I can eventually include all three variables in one message, but that will come later.  I want the ability to disable one or two as needed.  If the scale becomes unreliable, I would simply stop that cronjob from running.  Once I see all sensors behaving, I expect I will write one combined script.

Would it be a bad idea to have three cronjobs all scheduled at the same time (\*/5 \* \* \* \*)?  None of them are more than 50 lines of code and each one does a [requests.post](https://requests.post) to send the data."

*Processing img 2p48lj530fq61...*

As a result, I'm currently working on the project called *""ChainMetric""* which consists of four parts:

1. [Permissioned blockchain network](https://github.com/timoth-y/chainmetric-network) for storing sensor readings based on [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) 
2. [RPi Zero W powered IoT device](https://github.com/timoth-y/chainmetric-sensorsys) equipped with various sensors for harvesting environmental conditions and publishing them into the blockchain ledger
3. [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/timoth-y/chainmetric-contracts) for validating received data against previously assigned requirements
4. [Cross-platform mobile application](https://github.com/timoth-y/chainmetric-app) for monitoring received data, assigning requirements, and getting notifications in case a violation happens

*Processing video 480s1uv31fq61...*

The main idea here is to provide a *general-purpose supply-chain monitoring solution*, and by leveraging blockchain immutability and data transparency such a tool can be pretty powerful and useful for businesses related to food, chemistry, and really any type of assets that require monitoring of their storing and delivering conditions.

I am writing the embedded device driver in my favorite and programming language - Go. Since being a cloud developer where this language is a total kicker, I've decided to try using it in my embedded project too, and I actually was very surprised how well it performed! The most powerful advantage Golang gives I think is its famous [concurrency model](https://blog.golang.org/pipelines) which makes complex system programming a total breeze. The library situation with Go was also surprisingly good, I was able to find most of the needed libraries available online, like drivers for sensors or displays, I2C, SPI interfaces, etc. 

All the embedded device code is open-sourced and available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/timoth-y/chainmetric-sensorsys](https://github.com/timoth-y/chainmetric-sensorsys)

I've also referenced other project-related repositories in the bullet list above, so in case you're interested in blockchain, smart contracts, or mobile development, please consider visiting them too.

This project is still in progress, and I am planning to post more updates here. Thanks for reading!"

raspberry_pi,Recommended Distros for Raspad 3?,"I was a kickstarter backer on the Raspad 3 (a Raspberry Pi-powered 10"" tablet). Finally got my hardware yesterday. Haven't set it up yet because I need to get another Raspberry Pi 4. However, looking through their manual, it looks like the distro they created to go along with the Raspad probably isn't going to satisfy my needs. 

The Raspad 3 comes with an accelerometer shim chip to add on to the GPIO pins to detect the tablet's orientation and flip the screen accordingly. Besides that, I presume part of what's built in is the ability to work well with a touch screen.

Any other Raspad 3 backers tried other distros that they would recommend? I guess my top priority would be a good touch screen experience. Second priority would be the ability to use the accel chip to determine orientation rather than having to manually push a button. That said, I don't imagine I'll be doing lots of orientation flips. Web, book, comic reading would most likely be in portrait orientation and horizontal would be for video content or if I needed it to be stable while sitting on a surface. So I could live with doing it manually if I had to.

I don't know if there are other optimizations they've done. I thought I recalled folks who installed Ubuntu for Raspbery Pi saying it was too underpowered for Youtube.

Who knows, maybe their purpose-built distro will be fine. (It just really reminds me of back in the day when it was Windows 3.1 and lots of companies (like Packard Bell) would make their own UIs that hid a lot of the complexity for the average user)

Thanks for any advice you could throw my way."

raspberry_pi,"Is there a ""market"" for a highly pluggable news aggregator?","Hey,  
I'm a programmer and I often work on my passion projects.

Recently I've got my hands on the latest Raspberry Pi and a 9 inch IPS screen - and I'm loving this thing.

I've recently created a stock ticker and it met with a good reception, so I figured I would ask.  
Is there a ""market"" for a highly pluggable news aggregator? - by ""market"" I mean - would anyone use it? (for free).

Technically, I know that I just NEED this kind of an app, because I often waste time jumping from reddit to youtube, then youtube to github, then github to Yahoo Finances, then YF to Steam... you get the idea.  
It just sounds sensible to have an app that fetches all the interesting info and puts it in one place, then pops updates as they happen.

I was thinking about something along these lines:

\- web app - cross-platform, lightweight, and easy to customize  
\- sorting - sort by category, date, length, source..  
\- filtering - filter by category, tags, date, length, source, content..  
\- categorization and tagging - manual or automatic categorization and tagging  
\- plugins - support for CScript plugins (one of these) that fetch news using various methods: SMTP client, Web client, APIs, RSS and 'what-have-you'.  


Tell me what you think - perhaps you got more suggestions, or perhaps a thing like this already exists?"

And using these to form a long lasting low power consumption laptop. You could also convert it into a 2-in-1 Data server/website host by tucking in a small USB SSD. Or you could even use this as a camping laptop! it'd be the perfect laptop for camping, with it's extra large battery and ultra low power consumption, it could be the perfect Hotspot machine for web browsing."

I recently bought a Denon AVR S750H, hooked up my PS3, steamlink and one of my raspberry pis.

When I select my raspberry pi, I get green lines displayed, but only on 1080p, not on other resolutions.When I connect my raspberry pi to another input with another cable, I still see green lines. When I connect my PS3, I don't see green lines. This is why I ruled out problems with the cables or the AVR. One must think it is the pi, right?

Well, when I connect the pi directly to a display, I see no green lines. So it can't be the pi.

My conclusion, there must be something going wrong in the communication between the pi and the AVR.

I tried different things in config.txt, but no solution yet. I tried:

* Manually setting hdmi\_group to 1 (CEA)
* Setting hdmi\_safe 1, then manually selecting 1080p as resolution.
* Some other things I can't really remember, after reading through [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md) multiple times I've seen every option so many times, I can't really say what more I tried and what not."

[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/maztcs/2021_mar_22_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://old.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

[https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js/issues/33/](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-js/issues/33/) so I thought what a perfect oppurtunity to give back to the open source community while building myself a high end security camera."

I can use the buttons to activate separate LED lights no problem.

I'm pretty new to the whole electronics aspect of all of this as well as the GPIO stuff although I've played around a bit. I'm assuming I need to set the ""button"" part as an input and the ""LED"" part as an output on separate GPIO slots. I tried doing that but got no dice.

For what it's worth I'm using RPi.GPIO for now. I've played around with gpiozero but didn't get any further."

raspberry_pi,stepper motor + pi: sleeping?,"I'm wiring up a stepper motor (NEMA 17 + A4988 driver) to my pi, and I just wanted to make sure i'm doing it right. I found [this](https://whatibroke.com/2019/08/10/a4988-stepper-motor-raspberrypi/) really great article and what i have wired up works, but I will periodically want to disable the motor (sleep, allowing it to freely rotate).

it seems like all the tutorials i can find simply suggest jumping the sleep and reset pins on the driver, but i probably want to hook sleep up to another GPIO pin and toggle it, high and low for active vs sleep. (i'm using the python RPi.GPIO package, so it's as simple as a ""GPIO.output(sleepPin,GPIO.LOW)"" (or high) command).

it was acting a little funny (weird jerking clicking noises) when i just had the 3rd GPIO wired to the sleep pin, until i *also* jumped reset and sleep (so the one pi pin hits both), then it works as expected. but is that right? seems weird.

I have a micro usb (which the device uses for serial), where I have cut it in two, and was thinking of connecting up the wires to the raspberrys pins.  
The device is using 3.3V for its communications, so my idea was to connect it up to the raspberrys pin 1, and then using pin 8 and 10 for the data cables, where ground will be connected to pin 14.  
Will this require anything extra, or will it even work at all?

I just imaged the OS onto the microSD card, added the ssh and wpa\_supplicant files, and SSH'd in to change the password. Everything good so far.

The tutorial I'm following for gphoto2 says to start with `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`. I have an excellent connection, and all 300 megabytes it wanted to use to update were downloaded in the first few minutes. It's been running for coming up on 2 hours though now. Primarily taking a long time to unpack a bunch of packages. Is this just an artifact of the Pi Zero having a relatively slow processor? How long can I expect this to take? I would have guessed that the Raspberry Pi Imager program would install a version of the OS that doesn't require 300 MB of upgrades out the gate."

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. If the voltage is less than 5V your power supply and/or cabling is not adequate. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)

9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).

17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

raspberry_pi,Raspberry pi smart power switch and charging circuit?,"Making my own little project, and wondering where to find a smart power switch and a smart charging module (or what they are called to look it up myself)

I’ll be using a battery power bank for portability, but also want it to charge off of wall power and charge the power bank and provide power to the system at the same time... doable? 
What parts should I look up for this to work, if so?

Thanks."
raspberry_pi,Why is RPi cheaper in the US than the UK?,"Being that the RPF is a British organisation, I find it surprising that in the worst of situations, a person in the United Kingdom may find a Pi 3 for the same price as a Pi 4 in the United States. And, in other circumstances, it's slightly cheaper to buy a Pi from the US, including paying for shipping.

That means that buying a Pi with thousands of air miles on it is cheaper than buying one with none for a person in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking at buying a Pi for 3D printing for a fair few months now, and really cannot justify the vastly inflated price for a person like myself in the UK. It's not even as if they set a number and set it to both GBP and USD (say making it $50 and £50 where $ =/= £), but it's a case where a majority of retailers in the UK list Pis at a number **greater** than the exact same US counterpart, based on a review of every single store listed on the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Not just MicroCenter (I know they usually have great prices), but almost every single retailer in the US had a numerical value less than almost every single UK retailer.

It's not IP based, as I've had people from multiple countries in Europe, Asia and the US check and confirm that I was not going mad.

What gives?"

raspberry_pi,Resolution confusion in Pi camera,"I am working with Pi camera for some time now. I tried a couple of resolution for my project. But 320\*240 is the best fit. When I read the [readthedocs](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.12/fov.html#camera-modes) page for Pi camera, they have mentioned that there are modes, and the minimum resolution according to the modes is 640\*480. They also mentioned that the camera's algorithm either upscale or downscale to nearest resolution. But if I am using 320\*240 it should upscale because there is no downscale option. So why does both resolution produce videos of different sizes?"

But if I come back 2-3 minutes later it works perfectly fine. This also happens when I try to ssh into the pi. I'm thinking there is some sort of power saving feature that powers down the pi. 

PS: I've done research but most of what I found was to stop monitors from going to sleep. It is not running the desktop version of Raspbian."

However I don't think the hardware can really do it but wasn't sure and would be interested if there was another way to do this.  I'd essentially want to take in a video (HDMI) signal and output USB mouse keyboard commands via the pi and have all that sent to the network by the pi (or whatever device it would be) over something like VNC. I feel like this must already be a thing but couldn't find anything and wasn't sure if a pi could even do this. 

I've also had an idea of doing this kind of thing for an old Atari where you could play real hardware over network.  It seems essentially the same but would be a lot more custom controller interface.  Is this a thing already and are there better ways to do this?"

raspberry_pi,Super simple config based Pi Day Twitter Bot (can watch for and respond to hashtags defined in a config file instead of having to touch the code),"I've wanted to create a Twitter bot for a while and used Pi Day as motivation to get it done by this weekend. This bot can be hosted pretty much anywhere, but I'm running it on a Pi Zero W at home.

My goal for this project was to create a very simple Twitter bot that is easy to configure. If you want to add a new hashtag to watch, all you need to do is add a couple of values in a config.ini file and the app does the rest. No need to touch the code at all.

The code can be found at [https://github.com/naztronaut/PiPyPie](https://github.com/naztronaut/PiPyPie)

You can see a demo of the project at [https://youtu.be/CvN9X5nqWH0](https://youtu.be/CvN9X5nqWH0)

It's pretty simple and the actual python code is less than 70 lines which includes the authentication and adding new responses/hashtags require zero edits to the actual code.

If you tweet at it with #PiDayHelp, it'll respond with various commands including #PiDayJoke which will send you a random Pi, Python, or Pie related joke. I admit there are some generic math, programming, and food related jokes in there as well.

Example:

To add a new hashtag to watch, you add it to the HASTAGS item as a comma separated list:

`HASHTAGS = HAPPYPIDAY,PIDAYHELP,NEWHASHTAGHERE`

Then with a `PI_DAY_MSG_` prefix, you just add the message:

`PI_DAY_MSG_NEWHASHTAGHERE = put your message right over here`

You can add as many as you want and the script will pick it up during every run.

To keep things simple, the script is run on a cronjob rather than having the Python code loop, so it runs once a minute.

The config piece can also be replaced with a Database, but I wanted to keep it super simple so it's easy to clone and get running without needing to worry about another layer.

All of this was cross posted from my subreddit at r/EasyProgramming"

I'm in a bit of a predicament -- I have a raspberry pi with an SD card that contains everything I need. I need to essentially send an exact copy of this SD card to someone else so that they can plug the copy of the SD card into their own pi.

I tried taking out the SD card from the pi, and plugging it into a windows computer to make an image of it. I figured I could take the image and move it to another SD card. However, this would not work, as, in order to do this, I needed to reformat the SD card, which I did not want to do, as that would delete the contents of the card (I think).

So I'm not quite sure what to do. I have two micro SD cards, one raspberry pi with a command line interface, and one windows computer. Both the windows computer and the raspberry pi have one microSD card input. How can I accomplish my goal?

I followed [this guide] (https://snapcraft.io/install/overseerr/raspbian) which was straightfoward enough, and everything seems to be installed correctly, this is the output I get:

* **Step 4:** Navigate to 'S4 Hostname'
* **Step 5:** Modify hostname

I am working on integrating an MPU into this system and it is trying to use the same wires(i2c/SDA/SDC) if connected to the Pi.

I am aware you can do software i2c but just out of curiosity.

If I tried to share both and assume that the Nano doesn't expect to be read, it's mostly a one directional command (does not emit back to RPi) and the MPU is primarily read... I think this would work... despite sharing the same wires.

Probably noisy. Other thoughts would be to connect MPU to Arduino Nano instead and pipe the values back up to the RPi by i2c. Concern there is speed/accuracy."

raspberry_pi,[Project Help] Trying to create a raspberry pi spotify player by either resurrecting the RPi CM based Slice media player or using a standard rpi,"Hello All

I am trying to create a raspberry pi based spotify player. I have a couple of old rpis lying around so the plan was to use raspotify and spotify connect.

So I have a Slice media player that would be perfect - it hasn't be used in ages, but I think it would be perfect since it already has a built in DAC etc for better sound quality. But since the project has died off, I am finding it hard to find resources to help with that. One thing in particular would be controlling the LED strip that runs around the case.

Apart from resources for repurposing the slice hardware, one thing I'd also like to know is if raspotify can be used with hardware buttons. Its a spotify connect device, so its really designed to be controlled by your phone or other device, but being able to use the slice remote or some hardware buttons would be pretty cool.


Another option would be to use a standard Rpi and a DAC and hardware buttons, but If I could get the Slice working, that would be cool.

Lastly, I have looked into raspotify, but are there other methods of playing spotify on the rpi that would fit my purpose better?"

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago, I finally ordered my first Raspberry Pi for a project I'm working on, I also ordered a case, HDMI cable and power supply with it. This morning, I got a message saying that my package was waiting for me in at the collection point! I happily jumped in some clothes and went to get it.

Only to find out that they've send me all the accessories with a small letter saying that the Pi itself is on backorder and might take quite some time to arrive! :(

raspberry_pi,Don't disable ipv6...,"...if you want X11 Forwarding to work over ssh!

I spent hours trying to figure out why in the blue blazes I couldn't get X11 Forwarding to work.  Normally, I never really cared - if I want CLI access, I use ssh.  If I want GUI access, I use VNC or RDP.  But for one reason or another, I thought ""hey, it would be really neat if I could run just *one* remote linux gui app on my local desktop, rather than an entire remote desktop"".  So, I started working at this.  

MobaXterm has this neat little feature during the initial connection where it gives you a formatted banner about some of the details of the ssh connection - X11 Forwarding, compression, etc.  I'd noticed in the past that most of my devices showed X11 Forwarding as 'enabled', with a green check mark.  Not all of them, though.   Every once in a while, one showed 'disabled' with a red X.  Again, I never really paid any attention to that, because well... I didn't use it.  Now, though...

At first I thought it was a Raspberry Pi problem... then maybe a DietPi problem... then maybe a MobaXterm problem.  Thing is, I saw *lots* of recommendations for MobaXterm for *exactly* this use - it comes with built-in Xwindows support, no need for another external program like with PuTTY / Xming.  And I saw more than a few examples of people connecting with RPi's.  Yes, I had 'X11 Forwarding' uncommented in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and yes, it was toggled to 'yes', and yes, it was the sshd_config file, not the ssh_config file, and yes, I had xauth installed.  WTF?!?

After giving up on reading yet another tutorial, because all they ever show is what happens when everything works *right*... I was wading thru page after page of search results on DDG.  Finally stumbled across a thread on Unix StackExchange, which linked to [a ten year old thread on linuxquestions.org](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/x-forwarding-though-ssh-not-working-%24display-not-set-879365) that mentioned a bug in openssh: disabling ipv6 breaks X11 forwarding in ssh. 

Part of me couldn't believe that this would possibly turn out to be the fix.  Ten year old bug, and still silently breaking things?  Naw...

Yep.  During initial configuration of this particular RPi, I'd turned off ipv6 because hey, I don't need that crap for my home network!  Turns out that was probably why I sometimes saw MobaXterm show X11 forwarding as 'disabled', and sometimes not, as I nuked and reloaded various configurations testing one thing or another.

Fired up dietpi-launcher, got into the dietpi-config tool and turned back *on* ipv6 networking, re-enabled 'prefer ipv4', saved and rebooted.  Voila, I now had X11 forwarding!!!  And yes, it works ;)

For those of you not running DietPi... it's still worth knowing.  I had such a hard time finding and piecing this together that I thought I'd put it out here in hopes someone else may benefit!"

Product: raspberry pi zero W
Project: pi hole ad blocker
Pi OS: Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)

I have followed multiple blogs online with no luck. I don’t even want to talk about wireless setup but I seriously thought that the pi-&gt;usb-&gt;Mac method would work, here’s what I did 

Basically, in config.txt I added ‘dtoverlay=dwc2’ at the very end and in cmdline.txt I added ‘modules-load=dwc2,g_ether’ exactly as indicated here 

https://desertbot.io/blog/ssh-into-pi-zero-over-usb

No luck. I realize that this is an old article but all the articles I find are using Raspbian Buster and they ALL have this non working link:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

So that leads me to believe that my problems lie in outdated tutorials because the contents of the cmdline and config .txt files are significantly different from what is shown here in step 1:

https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget

(yes I know it’s windows but the contents of the .txt files should be the same regardless of host OS being used, unless of course years have passed, like in my case)

One last thing to note is that I had to make copies of these .txt files because my Mac would not let me edit them. So I copied originals, added what needed to be added, removed originals from sd card and pasted my changed .txt files back in, same name and everything. 

I know this is long but god I hope someone will have read this and have something to help me. I’m really excited to be messing with IT and computers and networking and stuff and this is my first step for me, any help would be immensely appreciated!"

raspberry_pi,2021 Mar 8 Stickied 𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊 thread - Boot problems? Display problems? Networking problems? Need ideas? Get help with these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/lvo2c8/2021_mar_1_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy (such as playing h265/x265 video) and/or get a new SD card. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Just your standard copy paste 1.8tb of hardrive - Will that work?,"Hi Fellow pi users, 

I'm trying to copy a load of video files, first attempt I found out pi os does not copy file created time, which is a problem for me.  Took a look online at some standard Debian code and came up as a good way to copy. i.e. the screenshot 

The first time i copied took about 20 hours (i used the file system like windows), but the shell does not give me any kind of update on how my command is running.  Should i expect similar runtime, if the line works at all that is?

raspberry_pi,I don’t quite know what to google as I don’t know the names of what I want.,"Hello there!
I’m an artist and I make fake products. One of the things I am working on is a “tree detector”. Basically it’s a button that when you push it a screen shows a loading style animation and then says the word “possibly”. I need to know how to make this work. It needs to be as cheap as possible, so I don’t think I can put a whole arduino or raspberry pie into each one I make. I think I need to write the code and then use one of those to upload the code onto a micro controller which is connected to the button and the screen. My question is- is there a beginner project that y’all know of that is similar that I could base mine off. 

TLDR- I know nothing. I need a button connected to a screen that shows some text when I push the button. How?

Cheers in advance for any help!"

raspberry_pi,Stateless Raspberry PI,"I know the subject isn't new but here is my attempt at creating a so called ""Stateless Computer"". (More about the subject in this blog  [https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/12/23/state\_harmful.html](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/12/23/state_harmful.html)  ).

So I used a Raspberry Pi 2, Model B, V1.2 since in theory it does not have any persistent memory on the board excepting the Memory Card you can insert in the slot.

To avoid the monitor sending over any possible data over I2C to the PI I used 2  VGA to BNC cables connected to each other (like the ones   [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0033AF5Y0/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=mobile_oh_details_)  ) and a HDMI to VGA cable to connect to the HDMI port of the board. (one like this  [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/HDMI-INPUT-to-VGA-OUTPUT-Converter-Adapter-Cable-1080p-for-PC-TV-Monitor-Black/181963762606?hash=item2a5de2abae:g:RHkAAOSwffRclLv3)  ). I tryed to use the Raspberry PI default composite output (from the audio jack [adapter](https://tinkersphere.com/raspberry-pi-accessories/523-raspberry-pi-a-plus-b-plus-composite-to-rca-adapter.html) )  but latest versions of Raspbian don't seem to support it anymore.

The setup seems to be working fine so far but I wonder if there is anything I miss. Is there any way for something like three letter agencies to hide some data on the pi if the memory card was taken out? Like writing the memory of some chip in the network card or even on the HDMI to VGA adapter?

I welcome any criticism.

raspberry_pi,PSA: Kodi 19 on RPi removes HEVC 10Bit support (for now) as part of graphics stack upgrade,"I've seen several posts floating around asking similar questions about Kodi 19 on an RPi and HEVC 10Bit content. This is a **public service announcement** to everyone to fill them in on some of the changes in Kodi 19.

Kodi 19 has undergone a [major graphics stack rework](https://www.reddit.com/r/AV1/comments/lp72k2/dav1d_final_update_for_082_news/goh5ujp/) and unfortunately HEVC 10Bit is not working yet. We suspect it will be working again on a point release on the 19 branch in the future.

**All** of the Raspberry Pis have a hardware h.264 encoder built in, but only the RPi4 has a built in hardware HEVC decoder. To play HEVC content on older RPis, Kodi uses a *software* decoder which has not been ported to the new graphics stack yet.

If 10Bit HEVC content on a Raspberry Pi is important to you then you have a couple of options:

* Stick with Kodi 18.9 for now. I have tested RPi2 and RPi3 on LibreElec and HEVC content plays fine
* Stick with 8Bit HEVC content as that code line is already working
* Get a RPi4 which has a hardware HEVC decoder and should be supported by Kodi 19 releases soon (betas are available today)
* Get a non-RaspberryPi based player

To be 100% clear: This **only** affects Kodi 19 on a RPi with 10Bit HEVC content. If you're watching h.264 then none of this matters to you.

Personally I'm sticking with Kodi 18.9 on LibreElec for now."

I'm looking to finally get on board and buy a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB) soon and use it for:

* Pi-hole
* PiVPN
* Homebridge

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming these should all be able to run on a single Pi, but if I'm being too ambitious please let me know. I don't really need the VPN piece right now since I'm working from home, but thought it would be cool/nice to setup.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the 'kit', I was looking at:

* Raspberry Pi Model B 4GB
* Heat Sinks
* NOOBS 32 SD Card
* Official PoE Hat
* High Pi Case

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at some of the known/official kits, like Canakit, but I wanted to do the PoE Hat and ensure the Case fit everything without any issues. Anyways, if anyone would be able to confirm the shopping list and that it would be able to run those 2 or 3 tasks at the same time, that would be much appreciated. Looking forward to getting started.

Thanks in advance."

Because I will be using this device outside of my home I will need it to boot into a wifi set up screen that will allow me, or a new user, to connect to a wifi network before booting into my software.

I know something similar is possible with PiBakery but it seems like the network needs to be pre-configured. I actually want it to set up like a new phone where it goes straight to the wifi connection before anything else.

My main thing is having a custom interface for the new network set up that is user friendly and once the connection is established, it loads my software."

Reposting for formatting. My apologies.

So  this little guy is my stats screen that sits inside my PC. I had a bit  of leftover space in the front of my O11 mini, so I ‘solved’ it with a  Raspberry Pi.

Firstly, I way  overpaid for the 7” display case, but it was the only one with small  enough bezels to fit in the space I had. The Pi sits in the back of it  and is powered off the same lead that powers the display. It’s a 12V  lead with an internal drop down to 5V for the Pi. To power the display,  and have it power on and off with the PC, I built a mildly terrifying  SATA to barrel plug adapter. My house hasn’t caught fire yet, so I think  she should be okay. This powers the display which powers the Pi in a  wonderful little conga line.

Mounting  the thing was pretty simple. It sits on the stock Lian Li pump bracket  with some creative use of L brackets to get it sitting up. In the photo  she’s not quite flush with the glass but that has been resolved since.

Next  up we have the software. I use MoBro, which is a neat little setup.  It’s still early on, and has rough edges, but the devs are super  responsive on Discord and through other channels, and have been really  good at working through problems and providing feedback. The software is  available for free, but there’s extra themes and the like for Pateron  supporters.

MoBro has an app that  runs on your PC, which the Pi picks up over a wireless connection and  displays. It’s super simple to set up, even for a numpty like myself.

The  only other issue was overheating. The Pi would get a little toasty, and  the fan built into the case was basically useless, so I had to throw a  few little stick on heatsinks in there. A final note is that this is  running on a Pi 3B+, because that’s what I had, but I imagine there’s a  fair bit of leeway in terms of what you use."

raspberry_pi,How to handle multiple simultaneous interrupts in Python?,"Hello, so this question is about both the Raspberry Pi and Python.  I'm building a monitoring circuit that needs to monitor multiple sensors at once, and report the data back over MQTT.  The main problem I'm having is that the RPi.GPIO interrupts only support one thread at a time to run the callback function triggered by interrupts, and the callback functions can only be executed sequentially, not simultaneously.  This won't work because I have multiple sensors that I need to count the rising edges for and calculate the amount of times they happen over a given time period. 

I've tried using multiprocessing and multithreading a couple of different ways, but it's not quite working how I need it to.  Here's the basic idea for the code:

    # Global Variables
    THREAD_EXECUTE = True # Used to tell the threads when to stop running
    SENSOR_1_TRIGGERS = 0 # Used to track number of rising edge triggers
    SENSOR_2_TRIGGERS = 0 # Used to track number of rising edge triggers

    def callback_1(input_pin):
        global THREAD_EXECUTE
        global SENSOR_1_TRIGGERS

        while THREAD_EXECUTE:
            GPIO.wait_for_edge(input_pin, GPIO.RISING, bouncetime=100)
            SENSOR_1_TRIGGERS += 1
    
    def callback_2(input_pin):
        global THREAD_EXECUTE
        global SENSOR_2_TRIGGERS

        while THREAD_EXECUTE:
            GPIO.wait_for_edge(input_pin, GPIO.RISING, bouncetime=100)
            SENSOR_2_TRIGGERS += 1

    def main():
        global THREAD_EXECUTE
        try:
            sensor_1_thread = Thread(target=callback_1, args=(pin_1,))
            sensor_1_thread.start()

            sensor_2_thread = Thread(target=callback_2, args=(pin_2,))
            sensor_2_thread.start()

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            THREAD_EXECUTE = False
        
        finally:
            sensor_1_thread.join()
            sensor_2_thread.join()
            GPIO.cleanup()
            exit()

Basically I just need a way to monitor multiple interrupts simultaneously, and handle the calculations in their own threads.  The above code kind of works, but it's very slow and still doesn't really handle each sensor input independently.  What's the best way to do this on the RPi with Python?

Edit for clarity: This project needs to monitor wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, temp, humidity, barometric pressure, battery voltage, and solar panel voltage.  Also it needs to control a relay that powers an exhaust fan.  The wind speed sensor and rainfall sensor are the two main sensors that really need fast interrupt responses.  Everything else can be run on a polling schedule."

[These are the buttons in question.](https://smile.amazon.de/gp/product/B0819ZZRKC/?language=en_GB) They come with zero technical details, schematics or anything. Also they have no LEDs or anything requiring additional power.

I put them into my arcade stick and they work as intended. I also bought some [quick connect wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1152) for easy wiring.

Here is a picture of the working assembly

It's connected to GPIO3 and ground, which according to several online tutorials is the correct way to wire those buttons. If I put the button on any other GPIO-Pin-Ground combination they don't work.

This is the python code I'm using for my tests.

&gt;**import** RPi.GPIO **as** GPIO

I had it installed at one point but it wasn't picking up any media files so I uninstalled it to try and reinstall it under the pi user instead of the plex user. I seem to have fucked myself though because now that I have Plex re-installed, I can't get it to start. I followed the instructions in an article by pimylifeup (can't link it because the website is banned on the sub) and then modified the /usr/lib/systemd/system/plexmediaserver.service file to change the User and Group to 'pi'. A common recommendation I've seen is to update the User and Group through a file called /usr/default/plexmediaserver, but that file does not exist.

raspberry_pi,Game Gear to Raspberry Pi Mod Kit Update,"It has been a while since I posted an update and a lot has happened with the Zega Mame Gear / Game Gear to Raspberry Pi Mod Kit so I though I would share some of my progress.

Most of the changes made were to make putting the whole thing together easier, mainly the positioning of connectors to make cable management a non-issue. So the case will pretty much shut and position the wiring itself in the correct place.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8z70pu78rij61.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46bf173304639bbc682dbeccf5db8510746b96b7

I switched from PWM audio through GPIO to I2S Audio to give a  cleaner and crisper sound with no interference, pops, crackles at all.

[Custom themes created just for this kit](https://preview.redd.it/63bdr44zqij61.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005e192c8d76e88c5d36a1fc41781907d74ac0f3)

Minor change was switching to a 1.6mm PCB which just feel better. And making them in Black, because black just looks cooler!

I thought I would also try my hand at creating some customer ZMG specific themes. I tried a few Retropie themes for smaller screens, and apart from superretroboy, they just don't cut it.

[Supports 4 buttons](https://preview.redd.it/ykqew5v1rij61.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a02e9ea5f30af42fae634a329b94cd2b36d83042)

Increases the conductive pad sizes to give a little better contact and stopped using GPIOnext for the inputs. For some reason GPIOnext just consumes too much processing.

Next step is to convert to a CM4. Ive already started the process. Although to be honest, I dont really think it will make that much difference in the games you can actually play with 4 buttons.

For  a few years, I was able to run a Pi 3 as a little NAS so I could backup  files from my Windows 10 laptop(s) remotely and stream movies.  It ran  DietPi and setup was dead simple.

One  day, it just stopped working.  One device at a time stopped being able  to see the shared drive, a 2 Tb external hooked to the Pi.  I tried and  tried but couldn't get it back in order, so I eventually put Raspbian on  and all was well for a few months, 'till the same thing happened; one  day, seemingly out of the blue, I couldn't see my shows or backup my  laptop's files.

There are a ton of tutorials that show how to set up these NAS setups, but few of them have troubleshooting, so where do I start?

I'm reasonably certain this came after a Windows update.

Today,  I have a brand new Pi 4 8GB that I've been beating my head against a  wall trying to get working as a SAMBA NAS.  As an experiment, I have  also tried on a Pi400 that I typically use for a 3D printer and no dice.

Right  now, I can ping and SSH into the Pi from my laptop, so I know that  Windows is kinda-seeing it but when I go to map a network drive and put in the IP and username/password I can't find the Pi with either of my  laptops.

When I type the IP or name of the Pi when trying to set up the network, it'll pop up asking  for the standard username and password, then pop up another window  asking for just the password, then just say ""Windows cannot access  \\\\192.168.1.xxx\\usb.""

I've spent  tons of time changing how the IP address was entered, double checking usernames and passwords, re-flashing the Pi OS\\DietPi and installing Samba and I can't make this work.

What's the next step to figuring this out?"
raspberry_pi,Confused about using my SSD as a boot device or storage device for pi as a media server,"I have been using my pi as a media server with plex, sonarr, and radarr on docker.

My previous configuration was using a 64GB sd card as a boot device and SSD as a storage device so that I can copy movies or tv shows simply by detaching the SSD and connecting it to a computer.

I came to know that using an SSD as a boot device makes the pi faster. If I do this I will lose the convenience of transferring the movies with ease.

Please suggest which is the better approach"

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy and/or get a new SD card. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)

9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?

15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

raspberry_pi,"Q: PI 3, Raid 1 for a media center?","Hi 

I'm in need of some advice. I've been using a Raspberry Pi 3 with 3 dual 2.5"" hard drive enclosures for a few years. I had them setup in what I thought was spanning mode but a recent check on the dip switches make me think that I was using them in raid 0 mode. Anyhow, I'm about to add 2 more enclosures and bump up my storage.

I have the following hard drives:

3 x 2TB, 1 x 4TB and 6 x 5TB drives and am thinking of setting up the PI 3 with raid 1. I'm looking to make as much of the setup as redundant storage and am considering the following setup:

Enclosure 1: Bay 1 = 2TB, Bay 2 = 4TB in JBOD mode

Enclosure 2: Bay 1 = 2TB, Bay 2 = 2TB in Raid 0 or Spanning mode

Enclosure 3: Bay 1 = 5TB, Bay 2 = 5TB in JBOD mode

Enclosure 4: Bay 1 = 5TB, Bay 2 = 5TB in Raid 0 or Spanning mode

Enclosure 5: Bay 1 = 5TB, Bay 2 = 5TB in Raid 0 or Spanning mode

&amp;#x200B;

Then use the PI to create raid 1 volumes as following:

&amp;#x200B;

Volume 1 would be 4TB drive in Enclosure 1 &amp; both drives in enclosure 2 (4TB)

Volume 2 would be both drives in Enclosure 3 (5TB)

Volume 3 would be Encosure 4 &amp; 5 (10TB)

&amp;#x200B;

The second - what system should I install? Raspbian? Ubuntu with dockers? How do you recommend to set it up, if the whole idea makes sense at all?

raspberry_pi,Clientless VNC through a browser - Working!!,"So I had a very specific use-case, and after way too much troubleshooting I finally got it to work. Figured I'd share here in case someone else needs to do something similar.

Basically, I wanted my users to be able to VNC into a Pi, but didn't want to walk them through installing a VNC Client (Most don't even have admin access on their laptops).

&amp;#x200B;

I found [this guide](https://www.m-opensolutions.com/installing-guacamole-on-raspberry-pi/) which got me started, but it was rather outdated and had some issues:

&amp;#x200B;

First guac 0.9.14 was giving me make issues, so I skipped step 4 and downloaded 1.3.0 (both server and client) direct from [here](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/1.3.0/).

Step 5 proceeded as normal, just change all the "" 0.9.14 "" to ""1.3.0"" (and any other place you see it in the guide).

I ran into some javadoc issues when building with Maven in step 6, but was able to solve that by installing jdk8 and changing it to default before running "" mvn package "":

`sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk`

`sudo update-alternatives --config java`

Finally, I didn't want authentication since this application will be behind a manufacturing network firewall, however, it seems they depreciated auth-noauth after 0.9.14.  My solution was to download ""guacamole-auth-noauth-0.9.14.jar"" from [here](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/0.9.14/), un pack it, and edit the top line of ""guac-manifest.json"" from

`""guacamoleVersion"" : ""0.9.14"",`

to

`""guacamoleVersion"" : ""1.3.0"",`

Packed it all back up as guacamole-auth-noauth-1.3.0.jar, and placed it in the directory on the last line of step 8.

The rest of the guide worked perfectly

Additionally, I didn't want to give the users a long ugly URL, so I installed  lighttpd and redirected:

`sudo apt-get install lighttpd`

`sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html`

Copy the below into this file (changing your IP obvi):

`&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`

`&lt;html&gt;`

`&lt;body&gt;`

`&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""0; URL='http://XX.XX.XX.XX:8080/guacamole'"" /&gt;`

`&lt;/body&gt;`

`&lt;/html&gt;`

Now all they have to do is type the IP of the Pi into a browser, and it takes them right in."

I have only done basic testing so far but it looks like this might be a handy option to deal with IPv6 addresses that aren't mapped to DNS names in the Pi-Hole logs and UI.

It also offers a solution for folks using more than one Pi-Hole, serving systems that only accept a limited number of DNS resolvers as it removes the v6 ones allowing a full set of v4 ones to be present. In my case I have two Pi-Holes and some systems only accept three DNS server addresses out of the four offered.

raspberry_pi,Beginner fiddling with the GPIO pins. Has the Pi cobbler been discontinued?,"Hello everyone. I'm one of those people who've owned several units of RPi for years and never really do anything with them. However, I had a sudden inspiration yesterday so I'm starting out my journey exploring the possibilities using the GPIO pins. I'm using the 3rd edition of the Getting Started with Raspberry Pi book as a reference and it mentions the Adafruit Pi cobbler. However, it seems like it's out of stock everywhere and I'm not sure if that's because of the limited business operations in the UK due to the pandemic and Brexit, or if it's been discontinued in favour of a better way to do what it does. I know I can just easily get a female-to-whichever jumper cable, but I'm curious if that's the most optimal thing to get. I already have a breadboard and a bunch of male-to-male jumper wires."

raspberry_pi,"EndBASIC: A retro-looking BASIC environment, now with Raspberry Pi support","Hi folks,

Over the last year, I've been working on this side project called EndBASIC. The goal has been to develop a retro-looking, limited BASIC environment with which to teach programming to (my own) kids although... I gotta say that, so far, I've been having much more fun with this than them 😅

Last month, I had the idea of dusting off an old Raspbery Pi and figuring out how to control hardware with it. And what a better way than getting a beginner's project kit, following some of the example circuits, and then adding support for it to this simplified language to control the platform!

Things are still extremely limited right now but are functional enough for a ""show and tell"" kind of thing -- so I've just released a new 0.6 version. With it, you can do some form of GPIO manipulation on these little machines and hopefully have some fun. The next step I'm envisioning is to work on getting a little LCD to work, which seems to require SPI.

But until then, enjoy, and I'd love to hear from you!

raspberry_pi,[PSA] Avoid the LABISTS starter kits.,"Just as a heads up, I bought the LABISTS Raspberry Pi 4 kit (8GB RAM, with 64gb SD Card) and it is just all around a bad experience. The case doesn't fit the Pi well, so that it is really hard to plug in (and unplug) RJ45, or USB plugs. The fan is ridiculously loud, and at a super annoying frequency (doesn't matter if you connect it in quiet mode, it is still loud). Temps climb to 80C+ and throttle after just 20-30 mins of stress testing,idle is 48-50C, so the cooling is laughable. 

On top of that the thermal tape shipped for the heatsinks isn't really a thermal tape, more like glue that if anything hurts thermals. It is a huge PITA to remove if you change your mind (took meg 40 mins of scrubbing with isopropyl alkohol and trying to get it off). 

All around it is not a good value, I bough the FLIRC case for much less, it has proper thermal tape, and thermals don't go above 60C even after prolonged stress testing. The case is also passively cooled, so no noise and much smaller in footprint as well.

So all in all the package is super not worth it, the only thing I got out of it was an SD card with Raspbian preinstalled (not worth it), a HDMI to mini HDMI cable (also not worth it), and a nice looking USB-C power adapter (pretty much the only thing I use now)."

raspberry_pi,Cellular Pi Light Matrix Project,"I am working [on this project](https://cache.getlazarus.org/images/led-matrix.jpg) that is a cellular mobile 64x16 WS1812 LED display inside a custom frame. Inside said frame is a Pi Zero W which controls the display and also hosts / exposes a front facing website via cellular networks. I'm also including a [GPS UART module](https://www.amazon.com/Microcontroller-Compatible-Sensitivity-Navigation-Positioning/dp/B07P8YMVN) so that people who visit the website can locate the real world location of my LED display. Since the 1024 pixel can potentially use a lot of watts, I will eventually be mounting the display and its frame on the back of a powered wheelchair. As I plan to drive the sign around town, I'll tap into the 12V batteries of the chair to provide power for the display and the Pi Zero W,.

Currently, I'm finalizing the inputs / output on the back of the case, and am writing the display control website. The website is being written using Mono 4.8 using C# and with the help of my [custom web framework](https://github.com/sysrpl/Codebot.Web). As the display will be driven around my town, people who see it (I will have a custom domain for the display) will be able to control what is on the display, including choosing images, playing videos, creating overlay text and so on. I may also include other things like puzzles, trivia, and  other content on the display.

I plan to add an external handheld wired remote control with and LCD and input wheel allowing me to track interaction from other people as I drive the sign around town. With the handheld remote I will be able to live tracking the web requests my display handles, and approving / disapproving of user content, and also block out spammers or the inevitable posters of penis images or vulgar text.

If you're interested in updates, after I finish the 3D printing the back control panel, and writing more code I'll be posting two websites / pages. One page will be hosted in the [learning section](https://www.getlazarus.org) of my programming site and outline the project in greater detail include wiring photos, diagrams, and source code overview. The other site will be the live site hosted by the Pi Zero W and control / interact with the display.

If anyone is curious, one of my prior projects was allowing everyone to control the (lights in my living room)[https://lights.splashdown.space/] over the internet.

Oh and finally, if anyone wants to contribute pixel art or animated GIFs, send me a PM. I'll be sure to give you credit. Just remember this is a 64x16 pixel display. I can handle bigger images, but they'll have to be scrolled across the display to fit.

Thanks for reading, take care, and don't hesitate to ask any questions!"

For more details I wrote a post about it here [The Wireless Radio Controller](http://jrsautomation.com/2021/02/17/the-wireless-radio-controller/). I am using a RS485 Pi Hat for the communication. The only issue is with Node-RED and the ""node-red-modbus-contrib"" node where you cannot talk to multiple Modbus nodes at the same time.

raspberry_pi,Raspberry continues python script that has been in time.sleep() after power outage?,"Hi there, I just stumbled across a really weird thing (maybe it is supposed to be like that but let me explain it first...)

I have a crontab runnting a Python Script whenever my Pi reboots.

The Script contains the following simplified logic, to be specific I can tell that this was the state when the power outage occured:

A Main.py, which spawns another thread that just updates my E-Paper Display every 15 minutes fetching Data from an API while doing so. So my Main Script was in a long sleep phase (like 2 hours in of 5 hours total). The E-Paper Thread was so too.
Then several power outage occured in my house, which means by my logic the PI must have had restarted, right?

However if i look into my logs, I can only see that the Internet Connection was faulty during the Power Outage (bc. my router was offline too ofc) but nothing shows that the script has been restarted.

The Script is running too (checked with ps -aef | grep python), and when I check the CPU Time of the Script has been reset to be like 2 minutes now.
Also the PI must also have suffered a Power Loss because when I check uptime it says it is up since AFTER I got power again....

Is there some automatical functionality to recover a running Python Script which is in sleep?

I am totally amazed by this szenario, everything works, it seems like it has not been rerun because otherwise it must show in the logs (and I would have gotten a Telegram Message too whenever Main.py is started)

Anybody know somthing about this?
Please share your knowledge with me, I am curious why this works the way it does :)"

raspberry_pi,Pi Pico Unique Selling Point?,"Hi Pi Community,

I have searched the internet best I can to understand the value of the Pico vs something like an ESP chip.

I stumbled on some stuff which effectively says the key difference in programmable IO? Now I am very very new to the world of programming and electronics (Hence my latest book purchase is ""Electronics for Dummies"").

So what makes the Pico so different and valuable? Is it the PIO, or is there something I don't understand?

I see companies like Arducam coming out with camera modules and showcasing a setup that involves reading the output of a person detection machine learning algorithm (running on the Pico) with the camera. Now I am not detracting from what I am sure is something very impressive and leaps and bounds above my knowledge, but surely the true value of something like this would be to do so untethered from a more powerful PC? Otherwise why not just use that PC in the first place?

Or is the Pico really a way to popularise the micro controller market?

I appreciate this is an area I hold very little knowledge in, so excuse the naivety, I guess I just to better understand. I do own two Picos myself along with a Pimoroni display, so I certainly want to understand their value better and ensure I am using them correctly in future projects.

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/lfr0nw/2021_feb_8_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy and/or get a new SD card. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

I'm running it as a deadhead, I ssh from my laptop to it, and at that point it rung very close to things I do at work when connected to the vpn.

Do I need to worry about home network security with the raspberry pi being a gateway in - how can I ensure that someone across the world isn't able to access my local files - or am I generally safe unless I'm actively trying to invite people in (i.e. by setting up an actual VPN).

I guess the question is, from a complete networking noob, who understands nothing of networking... what should I review to understand this all a bit better (ideally without googling ""how to hack into someone's home network"" to understand vunerabilitites, as I feel that leads me down a quite different path!!)"

raspberry_pi,Need advice: PID on a flow-through heater or a stepper motor controlled valve,"Hi Engineers,

For our start-up we need some advice. We have a subsystem that heats water to specific set temperatures between 80 and 100 degrees (celsius). Tap water comes into the system via a waterfilter. Using a boiler is NOT an option as we need the water to be as fresh as possible. 

We have the following components:
- Control valve (for setting the input flow depending on the water tap) 
- Open/close valve
- Flow sensor
- Flow through heater (2300W) with integrated NTC temperature sensor
- Nozzle (output) 

We have the system working with a PID control on the heater (temperature as input, PWM dutycycles as output) that is controlled via a solid state relay (SSR). It takes us now about 45 seconds to heat up 250ml. 

Now, in order to heat up the water 5 seconds faster, a collegue has the idea of putting the heater always at 100% power and adding PID to a stepper motor controlled valve. 

I have a few concerns:
- Stepper motors need time to get to a position. This makes it slower and less reliable than PID on the heater where you can almost instantly add / stop adding energy.
- If the tap water pressure suddenly drops, the heater will go crazy and generate steam. 
- Stepper motors will wear off over time as mechanical components are constantly moving over very small angles at a very fast pace (PID) 
- It will take a bit of time before the new flow rate reaches the heater causing another delaying factor in the system

In my opinion, better solutions are:
- Sticking to PID on the heater and regulating the optimal flow rate ONCE when starting the system. Here we accept that we cannot be 5s faster without buying a more powerful heater. 
- Using a solenoid valve instead of a stepper motor that controls a valve when using with PID. Here we CAN put the heater at 100% all the time. 

I am wondering what you would advice me in this situation and what you think of this water heating system in general. We feel a bit stuck and our options on this subject differ.

Thank you very much in advance,

ME"

raspberry_pi,Pi 4B 4GB can't overclock - not even to 1510mhz. Tried everything.,"Hi

So I have been trying to overclock my Pi 4 for about 4 days now, with ZERO results.

I started out with `over_voltage=2` and `arm_freq=1750` and didn't see any change in CPU frequency after a reboot, however, the voltage change does work. I use `sudo s-tui` to stress and monitor along with rpi-monitor.

I am on Raspbian buster and have the latest firmware, #1401 according to rpi-monitor (I have done a `sudo rpi-update`).

I tried underclocking to 800, that works. I tried 1450, that works. But 1505, 1510 and 1550 have no effect. I have also tried over\_voltage values up to 6, with the only effect being a higher voltage. At `over_voltage=2` my voltage is 0.8938V according to rpi-monitor.

Governor is ondemand and `arm_freq_min` is default at 600.

raspberry_pi,Instrumenting sensor event processing in your home alarm/automation system,"A new version of [AlertR](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR/) was released today. Normally, I would not post such a trivial thing here, but this new version has a cool new feature some of you might like for your own projects.

First a short introduction for everyone who does not know AlertR: AlertR is a multi-purpose monitoring/alarm/signaling system. It allows easy integration of your own code/scripts/projects, as well as using the ready to use components (such as monitor Raspberry Pi GPIO pins). If you want to build a home alarm system with Raspberry Pis, you can do it easily with AlertR. If you want to monitor your internal services, you can do it easily with AlertR. If you want to keep track of stock and crypto currency prices, you can do it easily with AlertR. If you just want things to happen on Host B when an event occurs on Host A, you can do it easily with AlertR. Thanks to its client/server architecture, you are not confined on having everything only on one host, but you can distribute everything in your network.

Now to the new cool thing. The server component of AlertR processes sensor events (such as a sensor went into a ""triggered"" state or went back into a ""normal"" state) and distributes it to the components that ""react"" on this information (such as raising an alarm). Basically, it signals the other components about state changes of sensors. Now you can instrument this sensor event processing. How does it work? Well, you can write an instrumentation script in the language of your choice and the AlertR server will pass the sensor event data to your script. This script can now do whatever you want with this data (modify it, delete it, ...) and return it to the AlertR server. The AlertR server will then continue processing with your updated data.

This was rather abstract, so let me give you an example: let us assume you use the reminder of your Google calendar events as a sensor. And you want that such a reminder turns on a light in your living room. However, you do not want every reminder to do that, but only the reminder of the event with the description ""light on"". Now you can add an instrumentation script which will filter out every reminder event that does not have ""light on"" in its description field. You can do the same for ""light off"" to turn the light in your living room off. And all over sudden, you can use your Google calendar to schedule home automation events.

Or another example: every morning you open the window in your bedroom to get fresh air into it. However, you often forget to close it. This is especially annoying in winter, since everything gets really cold. You have the window in your bedroom connected to a GPIO of your Raspberry Pi and you want a reminder after 10 minutes, that the window is still open. However, in summer you always have your windows open and you do not want this reminder. With the instrumentation, you can now modify the sensor event when opening the window to check if it is already summer and thus suppress the reminder. Or perhaps even check the outside temperature and only start the reminder after 10 minutes if it is lower than a certain threshold, for example, 18 degrees Celsius. [For this example I wrote a shot tutorial how to do it with AlertR](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR/wiki/Tutorial-Developer-InstrumentSensorAlerts-Server).

So, perhaps some of you find this interesting and want to give it a try."

Upon first boot I noticed the WiFi connection to my home’s WiFi worked, but speeds on the browser are super slow. I figured I’d troubleshoot it later as I wanted to install Ubuntu on it before adjusting and troubleshooting.

Well after installing Ubuntu I’m running into the same problem. I tried updating  as well as Ubuntu and it still is painfully slow. It’s strange that sudo apt update and install speeds vary wildly, and other times the WiFi connection will just drop.

This doesn’t happen on any of my other devices so I’m at a loss on how to troubleshoot this. I really just want to use this to practice programming in JavaScript and Python and get used to navigating the terminal, but I can’t even seem to get bluefish text editor downloaded and installed.

I’m going to try to use my works WiFi, but really the WiFi works fine on every device in my home, so I’m at a loss if this doesn’t work. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!"

raspberry_pi,Input lag in Ubuntu 20.10 with 4Go Pi4,"Hello folks !

I recently installed `Ubuntu Desktop 20.10` running kernel `5.8.0-1015-raspi` on my Rasberry `Pi 4` and facing issues to troubleshoot a constant input lag. I always have the impression that the system is overall 0.5 to 1s behind my input despite hardware resources being high or low used and so far I am having hard time to pinned point a root cause.

This setup is 48 hours old with not much install yet (vscode, chromium, git, python3 and basic tooling to troubleshoot so far as ioping, htop, atop). Pi is having heat syncs and a fan for the CPU, no overclock.

`htop` is not showing a load average that could result in input lag in my opinion (between 1.5 to 2.5 where the Pi 4 is having 4 core), ioping result is showing healthy IO from my sd cards (between 0.5 us to 1ms in avg), memory is ok and swap is off. 

Looking to this [thread](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-on-raspberry-pi-feedback/18956), 20.10 has been created for Pi 4 and I guess having the 4Go version should run Ubuntu correctly.

Is anyone running 20.10 with a Pi4 and having acceptable input lag ?   
Any recommendations to troubleshoot further ?  
SSD in USB3 could help or overclock maybe ?"
raspberry_pi,Am I bat-guano crazy or is something very wacky with my Pi3B?,"I was trying to set up a simple circuit to drive LED strips via a TIP-120 using PWM on GPIO, but nothing was working. I tested everything, the LED's worked. I got rid of the strip and the TIP-120 and simply hooked a single LED between ground, a 330ohm resistor and the GPIO.

But there was simply no voltage on the chosen GPIO (5), even when I used pigs to simply set one output high. 

I found the gpiotest script, and ran it, and the LED blinked. But when I added a delay in its loop, I found that the blink came when a completely different GPIO was being written.

So I slowed the loop further, and tested every GPIO pin on my board, and the results are telling me either I am completely insane, the pin diagram I am using is 100% wrong, or my pi has entirely unique pinning.

The pi board has ""Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2"" printed on it.

The diagram I am referring to is here:

[https://pi4j.com/1.2/pins/model-3b-rev1.html](https://pi4j.com/1.2/pins/model-3b-rev1.html)

and these are the results of my tests:

If I use pigs to turn on

GPIO 2, it turns on the one labeled GPIO 8, on pin 3

According to [this](https://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Kernel_Panic_on_boot) troubleshooting, it might be a power supply problem, and how I was using a Samsung phone charger, it made sense.

I managed to build an RCA cable with a jack 3.5 and it actually works, i installed retropie and started using it. A week later suddenly my RCA stopped working and I don't know why, because I checked all the cables and it is ok. 

Anyway, I bought a good 5V 2.5A micro USB power supply to finally use HDMI and forget about it, but to my surprise, the problem still, I only get the ""colored splash screen"" and just after that ""no signal"". And my RCA doesn't work anymore :(

So I am not being able to use my retropie.

What can I do and why I have no-signal after ""colored splash screen"" being that now I have a good power-suply? (I bought the best in the country with a lot of positive review of raspberry users)

And why my RCA stoped delivering signal?

raspberry_pi,Cheap Raspberry Pi vs Cheap Laptop,"Hopefully this is the right place to ask this.

So if I understand correctly, the Raspberry Pi's original purpose was to be a cheap computer to teach computer science/programming in schools, however, once buying all of the extra peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc...) the price can quickly adds up to well over 100 USD.

A quick google search shows that the cheapest new laptop you can buy is 99 USD at Walmart. This seems like it would be a cheaper option than any Raspberry Pi setup I can think of, as it already has a screen, keyboard, etc... Now it's likely you can get cheaper laptops if you know where to look, but I couldn't find anything in my quick Google search.

My question, is as far as a humanitarian organization that focuses on teaching computer science would be concerned, would it be better to buy everyone a cheap laptop and then re-image it with a Linux OS, or to get a cheap Raspberry Pi setup?"

raspberry_pi,"Raspberry pi 4 8gb - What is the ""Best"" OS","Hey guys,

I've recently bought a Pi 4 8gb with a case and an SSD (SATA over usb). I decided to go ARM64 Ubuntu and it seriously underperforms not snappy, I would go as far to say, annoyingly slow. I have done some Google-Fu and in appears that a lot of people are saying this about Ubuntu ARM64 in General. 

I figured I'd give Raspberry Pi OS a go and apart fro. In the archives (6 month old beta build) I can't see it referenced anywhere which seriously confuses me given you really need a 64 bit OS for 8GB RAM.

What am I Missing here guys, I've thought of overclocking, but I figured i'de throw it out to the community and ask. What OS do you Choose for your 8gb Pi 4s and do you recommend Overclocking or leaving it Stock as a Rock!!!

Thanks in Advance!!!"

raspberry_pi,How does one completely remove kerberosio and its reset the default nginx config from raspbian buster?,"long story short I once made the mistake of trying to run kerberosio on my rpi4 server. It never worked, and it mangled nginx and took over port 80 such that even after removing the dpkg and completely removing nginx and all of its config files, it is *still* showing the (now even more broken) kerberosio landing page when I open it in a browser. (nginx isn't even *installed* and it's still serving the page. ***how???***)

I really need to get a default nginx config back and get it working so that I can install a new utility that uses it, and which I have been unable to configure in nginx."
raspberry_pi,Setting up a C/C++ development environment on the Raspberry Pi 4.,"After getting my RPi4 over the holidays, I had trouble setting up a good C/C++ environment for it.  None of the included IDEs are really suited for a large, multi-file based C++ project.

(Before anyone asks, yes, I know that you can use Visual Studio and remote access to develop for the Pi.  My goal is to develop for the Pi on the Pi itself.)

My IDE of choice on Linux-based computers is Netbeans, and has been for years.  I use [Netbeans 8.2](https://netbeans.org/downloads/old/8.2/), which I know is old but is the last version that supports C/C++ development (later versions support C/C++ by literally importing version 8.2 into themselves).  But attempting to install it on the Raspberry Pi through apt resulted in a broken install.  Netbeans is very finicky about what version of Java it will run on, and won't work with OpenJDK unfortunately.

I found that the JDK version named ""Linux ARM 32 Hard Float ABI"" on [this page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) finally gave me a working installation.  Extract the archive to its own folder, and then during Netbeans installation, point the Netbeans installer at it instead of the default one in /usr.  I like this solution because it means Netbeans and the 8.2 JDK it requires can do their own thing without changing the native JDK of the system.

After this I was able to import and build existing projects on the Raspberry Pi 4 that I'd previously built for x86 Ubuntu.  I'm looking forward to seeing what else I can do with this, and I hope the information I've provided has been helpful.  If anyone out there is also doing C/C++ development on the Raspberry PI, I'd love to hear how you're doing it!"

raspberry_pi,Slow LAN transfers to/from RPI via Syncthing. Where's the bottleneck likely to be?,"I've got an RPI4 with a 6TB BTRFS HDD connected via USB. 

The Pi runs Syncthing, and so does my Mac Mini, which sits next to it on the shelf. 

The two machines are both on [192.168.0.1/24](https://192.168.0.1/24) and are connected to my router via Ethernet. The Mac Mini has a 4TB AFS HDD connected via USB.

So, schematically:

6TB BTRFS HDD &gt; USB 3 &gt; Rpi4 &gt; Syncthing &gt; ethernet &gt; router &gt; ethernet &gt; Mac Mini &gt; Syncthing &gt; USB 3 &gt; 4TB AFS HDD

Transfer speeds when Syncthing is syncing folders are never more than 10MB/s, usually closer to 5 or 6. The router has Gigabit LAN and I can transfer between other machines on the network (eg. between two Macs) at much higher speeds.

This isn't the end of the world but it just feels like at least one bottleneck somewhere - maybe more - and I'm intrigued as to where it (or they) might be. 

I acknowledge that the bottleneck might not even be the Pi, but I have a suspicion it is, which is why I'm posting here! Plus, I'm sure other Pi users here have encountered/solved similar problems in the past too.

I'm hoping answers will help me decide how to approach fixing it. Eg, if the consensus is that it's the Pi, then I probably won't go out and spend hundreds of dollars on an SSD drive to replace the BTRFS HDD.

But if it might be worth, say, reformatting the BTRFS drive as something else, that's simple and easy to try!"

raspberry_pi,First time setting up a Raspberry Pi,"I have been racking my brain up with something I thought should have been easy. I bought my first Raspberry Pi and it finally got delivered. I have spent the entire day today, trying to create an ubuntu server on it. By mistake a got a mini HDMI, instead of a micro HDMI so I can't connect my monitor to my Pi.

So I read up on how to set it up in headless mode and ssh into it. I'm following the guide on this [page](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi). I downloaded the Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS file, 64 bit and flashed it on my SD Card. My laptop has an inbuilt SD Card reader, thankfully. I then put the sd card in the Pi, connected the ethernet cable and power cable last. 

The Pi starts up and red and green lights flash. I wait for a couple of minutes and then open PowerShell. I type in `ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.2`, which is the IP address for the lan cable I'm using. I get asked for the password which I enter as ubuntu, which is supposed to be the default password. But I keep getting ""Permission denied, please try again"". I have tried `ssh pi@192.168.1.2` as well, just in case, but nothing. I have tried using the password raspberry on both but that doesn't work either. I tried, reflashing the ubuntu image, just in case. Still nothing. I downloaded Raspbian Buster and flashing that (and adding the ssh file), but still nothing. I reflashed ubuntu and added the ssh file, because I read that ssh is not enabled by default on Ubuntu, cursing myself for not doing it before, but again this didn't work. I also tried using my wifi network instead of the ethernet, by changing the network\_config file, but then I wasn't able to figure out my Pi's IP address. Advanced IP Scanner didn't show any device with the names ubuntu or Raspberry or Pi or anything like that. Besides, I do want to permanently use my Pi with an ethernet cable, so I quickly abandoned that idea.

Please keep in mind that I have almost no knowledge of networking and I'm just trying to search for possible solutions and try them. So far, nothing seems to be working. I've read multiple tutorials on doing a headless install of ubuntu server on a Pi 4 and they have the same steps, so I'm sure I must be doing something wrong or missing a step. Please help a noobie out here. All help is appreciated.

TLDR: Unable to ssh into a fresh install of Ubuntu server or Raspbian on a new Pi due to ""incorrect"" default password."

I'm seeing a lot of portable projects here, and I'm wondering how you're getting your power.

What I'd want, is something that can output 3A @5V (enough to drive an RPi4) from a battery, which can be charged while the Pi is still running (load sharing, essentially). 

I have no problems when discharging only - for that, I just use either a regulator or a boost converter - it's the charging and discharging at the same time I wonder about. I know there is the Adafruit power boost thing, which does load sharing - but it's only capable of outputting 1A.

What's your suggestions?"

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins while the Pi is busy and/or get a new SD card. When your Pi is doing lots of work it will draw more power. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Powered USB 3.0 hub for RPi 4 B + 2 USB HDDs,"Quick background: I have a Raspberry Pi 4 B, running (currently) Raspbian off an SD card, with 1 USB disk attached (media storage for PleX), which so far works perfectly fine. 

Having read though that running the system from the SD card could end up in pain once the writes start to go awry, I wanted to add another disk to move the system and user dir to. 

Given it a quick try, but the disk(s) started beeping at me in alarm, I assume because of not being fed enough power by the Pi. After some reading around, it seems I should get myself a powered hub to feed the disk, and perhaps even the Raspberry from it. 

The problem is all threads I've found are usually from many years ago, the eLinux [RPi Powered USB Hubs](https://elinux.org/RPi_Powered_USB_Hubs) page doesn't seem to be updated in quite a while too (and lists mainly USB 2.0 hubs), here comes my question then - what are currently recommended powered USB 3.0 hubs that could handle a setup like this?"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 4 Wifi Connection issues,Hey guys I was given a raspberry pi rover for my micro controller class in college and I'm having issues getting it to connect wifi. Since it is in a rover I was given an sd card with it and really had to do little set up to the pi as it was all configured from the factory. This is causing issues for me since for whatever reason the regular way to connect the pi to wifi will not work with the software installed. My professor showed us we had to use the raspbian wifi configuration portal on the browser. I have tried to connect this way and it will tell me my wifi settings were updated successfully however it doesn't actually make a connection to the internet. Not sure if anyone on here can help but figured this was the best place to ask. Hopefully I gave enough information if not I will try and answer questions.

raspberry_pi,Need help: struggling to set up a composite ethernet / audio / mass storage Linux USB gadget,"Hi everyone,

I would like to set up a Linux USB gadget with multiple device  functions. When plugged in to a host device (Windows/Linux/Android) the  Linux system should be detected as an Audio Device (UAC1/UAC2 Device)  with audio in- and output, as an ethernet port to establish to  communicate over USB and as a mass storage device to transfer files  easily.

I am already able to configure all of these functionalities  individually and they work fine. But when bring them together (see  script below), I have problems with the UAC1 audio device at the host.  Mass storage and ethernet work fine at the host device (in my case  Windows 10). Also the Audio Gagdet shows up in the device manager, but  with an error code: The device cannot be started (code 10).

https://preview.redd.it/7owe25vohif61.png?width=383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ebd69f00c5307513441fed3114e47299a7b8cb2

I have already ruled out that it is due to mass storage, because mass  storage gadget and audio gadget work fine together. Therefore, I think  that the problem is due to the interaction between the ethernet (RNDIS)  and the audio gadget.

A big part of my code is based on this script: [https://gist.github.com/Gadgetoid/c52ee2e04f1cd1c0854c3e77360011e2](https://gist.github.com/Gadgetoid/c52ee2e04f1cd1c0854c3e77360011e2)

Defining all those buttons in tkinter was pretty annoying, is it possible to do it procedurally in a loop or somethin? At 3x3 size it's only 9 buttons and i'd like to make it variable size to chose before start, but i have no idea how to make variable numer of frames and buttons in tkinter."

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi relay board to reset cellular modem at remote site.,"Howdy folks,

Out in the mountains I have a solar powered Raspberry Pi that I use for tracking airplanes. For the plane tracking part I am using the guide from ADSB Exchange.    
https://www.adsbexchange.com/how-to-feed/adsbx-custom-pi-image/    

    

For internet access I am using a netgear LB1120 with an external antenna.    
https://www.netgear.com/home/mobile-wifi/lte-modems/lb1120

Power comes from a 100 watt solar panel controlled by a cheap charge controller and a cheap lawn tractor battery.    


This all works great during the day, but the battery does not have enough capacity to keep things running overnight.    


In the morning when the solar panel gets enough light and powers everything back up, the Netgear will not connect to the internet. The only way I have found to get it to work is by resetting it to defaults either through the web GUI or by pushing the reset button.    

This site is over 100 miles from where I live, and during winter I have to walk the last mile. Uphill. Through the snow. This makes resetting the device a real pain.    

My solution was to desolder the reset button from the Netgear, solder wires in it's place, and connect those wires to a relay board on the Pi.

I then put together a script to trigger the relay for five seconds, then release.    
   


#!/bin/bash    
gpio mode 25 out        
gpio write 25 1    
sleep 5
gpio write 25 0    


To trigger this on bootup I added the following to my rc.local. The sleep is in there to give the Netgear time to boot up and be in a normal state before triggering the reset.

 sleep 45    
    /home/pi/relay.sh

Testing this on my bench at home it all seems to work as intended. Any thoughts before I deploy this on the next warm day?"

Its a fair amount of effort - not getting NextCloud itself setup - but getting the external local drive connected to the PI - then getting the correct permissions for NextCloud - then getting the subdomain setup - and port forwarding... whew!

I may also try to get PiHole running on the same Pi - we'll see!

Pretty excited to have my own private data cloud - on a $50 pc - plus a $200 2tb external SSD drive (upgradeable to 4tb or raid 1).

Amazing stuff

*UPDATE*  I was able to move my primary data folder to my external drive - (and turned off the external local drive app in NC)
Very odd though - I moved all the folders over - and couldn't see them in NextCloud Web UI - until I tried to create the folder name - once I did - I got an error that the folder already existed - then I could see it.  For example:
- moved folder :  'Joplin' to my external drive nextcloud data folder
- logged into Nextcloud Web UI - couldn't see it (confirmed it was there in SSH)
- tried created folder 'Joplin' (as I was going to move the data files after) - received 'duplicate folder error'
---  and - the folder I had moved 'Joplin' - with all the data files - showed up in my dashboard.
-  So I repeated that for all my folders - and everything appeared - assuming some database or log needed to be created/recognized and the add folder function did that.

So now - I'm not running on my Pi SD card for NExtcloud storage - its all on that 2Tb external drive.  Plus - I thought the external local drive setup I was using - was pretty 'clunky'"

I am inordinately proud of this little project! I have very little knowledge of code, but it's all come together quite nicely, even though I'm sure it's coded in the least optimal way possible!

An Arduino runs four capacitive soil moisture sensors and a DHT11 temp/humidity sensor. The Arduino is connected to a raspberry pi over serial, and the pi controls the irrigation pumps through a four-channel relay. The relay is powered from the pi, but the pumps have their own 5v supply.

The pi runs Node-Red, which parses serial readings from the Arduino to pump commands, &amp; Influx DB where all the data is stored and graphed with Grafana (which can then be viewed on my magic mirror), Node-Red also allows for individual control of the pumps with Alexa.

If my soldering skills weren't absolute arse, then I would try to clear up the rat's nest of cables, but I'm not really sure of another way of making it neater without soldering, and I am really bad.

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l52raf/2021_jan_25_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do. If you're plugging in USB devices try using a powered USB hub with its own power supply and plug your devices into the hub and plug the hub into the Pi.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi4 8GB seems useless as media player. What am I missing?,"So I bought Raspberry Pi 4 8Gb to use as a media player. I installed Raspberry Pi OS the one that official website recommends, connected USB HDD, installed transmission-daemon and Kodi. All I want is just download torrent files to external HDD and play them on Kodi. This started as a nice set up, I was able to watch 4K videos and was pretty satisfied with whole experience. However when I download something pretty soon computer becomes unresponsive and I have to reboot it. Turns out there is bug that is opened for years and looks like never gonna be fixed ( [USB3 disk writes trigger OOM reaper on Pi 4 · Issue #3210 · raspberrypi/linux · GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/3210) )

It provides workaround, use arm\_64bit = 1 flag in config.txt. Ok that fixes the downloading and out of memory  issue, however now I don't have hardware video acceleration, so I cant watch 4K HEVC or high bitrate 1080 videos anymore that renders whole setup useless again. This is extremely disappointing as my simple usecase is widely advertised on Internet as viable Raspberry Pi usage that is not working IRL and makes me regret spending money on this setup. Is there something I can try or just better scrap this BS board and set up normal PC?"

raspberry_pi,"Meet the TimeHat! A hat with a GPS receiver and precision real time clock, for sale now!","Hey everyone!

Like many others here, I have used a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with a GPS to act as a stable and precise source of time on my network for a few years now. Recently I started attaching a Maxim DS3231 real time clock to my time servers in order to maintain precise time if the GPS lock is lost, or if the server reboots or has to be moved. Initially I used protoboards to put this together, but I figured it might be a fun project to make some PCBs for. 

After speaking with some friends about the project, I discovered that there might be broader interest in these, so I have decided to make a small run of them to sell. I have priced them at $50 shipped anywhere in the US. I will gladly ship them internationally but keep in mind that even for a small padded envelope international shipping can be quite expensive. 

Each hat will come fully assembled and tested, and include a high quality CR2032 cell for the RTC (the GPS module has its own battery onboard), a magnetic puck GPS antenna with a 3m cable, and standoffs/scews for securing the hat to your Pi. For an extra $10 I will include a MicroSD card pre-configured with DietPi gpsd, and chrony so all you have to do is plug it in. The hats are built and ready to ship now!

Pics of the hat: https://imgur.com/a/B2swj4k

EDIT! I have created a webpage with a bit more information here: https://millerjs.org/timehat

FAQ:

* **Q: What parts did you use?** 
* **A:**  I chose the Dallas DS3231SN real time clock and ublox MAX-M8Q. These are excellent parts well suited for this role. The DS3231SN has a temperature compensated oscillator with a frequency stability of +/-2ppm, meaning they can keep correct time down to with *seconds* per year! The ublox MAX-M8Q is a high quality GNSS receiver that can pick up GPS and GLONASS satellites, meaning it will work well anywhere in the world.
* **Q: Some DS3231 modules have a design flaw! Did you account for this?** 
* **A:** Yes! Many DS3231 modules were designed for a rechargeable LR2032 which are not very common. If a CR2032 cell is used with these, you may have problems including premature death of the battery or even a fire. Thankfully this problem is easily resolved by removing a jumper resistor between the positive power rail and the battery. All of my modules have been corrected in this way and are safe to use with a CR2032.
* **Q: Why did you use breakout boards instead of buying the bare chips?**
* **A:** Speed and price, mostly. Both the RTC and GPS need supporting hardware, and by using pre-built breakout boards they are much easier to integrate into a hat like this. I also got good prices for both so it made sense to stick with this design. In the future I would like to make a more integrated version.
* **Q: What Raspberry Pi models will this Hat support?** 
* **A:**Any Raspberry Pi with a 20 pin GPIO header will work. Basically every model other than the first B and A.
* **Q: Are other single board computers supported?** 
* **A:**  Any SBC that uses the same pinout as the Pi *should* work. The only one that I have personally tested is the Odroid-C2. The biggest catch with using other boards is configuring the timing pulse input from the GPS. The Raspberry Pi makes this very easy, others may be harder. I am willing to help if I can.
* **Q: What pins does the TimeHat use?** 
* **A:**The DS3231 and MAX-M8Q are both powered from the 3v3 rail. The DS3231 is connected over i2c, using SDA and SCL. The MAX-M8Q uses UART TX/RX and GPIO4 for the timing pulse. 
* **Q: What software do you recommend?**
* **A:** I am partial to DietPi (due to its light weight and quick boot time) alongside gpsd and chrony. Chrony has a few features that I prefer over NTP, but the version packaged with debian/ubuntu/Raspbian/dietpi has a small bug that can be remedied easily by building a newer version. I'll gladly provide instructions for this to anyone interested.
* **Q: How did you settle on the price of $50 shipped?**
* **A:** Materials cost, time, effort, and other existing solutions. For example, the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2324) is $45 (before shipping!) and my hat is superior for a number of reasons: The MAX-M8Q is a newer and better-performing GNSS receiver than the MT3339, the SMA connector on mine is far more robust and reliable than the u.FL on the Ultimate GPS hat, finally, mine includes the RTC which the Ultimate GPS hat does not. I am not disparaging the Ultimate GPS hat, I just believe that mine is a better solution!
* **Q: Will you sell kits or bare boards?**
* **A:** In the future, if there is enough interest, sure. 
* **Q: Why didn't you do X, Y, or Z?**
* **A:** Maybe I had a reason, maybe I just didn't think about it? Send me and email and we can talk about it.
* **Q: Will you make resources available to those who are interested?**
* **A:** Yes! I will gladly share parts info, gerbers, and configuration files with anyone that wants them!"

From the command line via ssh , I can issue the command *DISPLAY=:0.0 xset dpms force on* to wake the screensaver, but it does not work issuing the command from either the **on\_event\_start** trigger or the or the **on\_motion\_detected** trigger. I have tried the command directly from  motion.conf as well as including it in a bash script. Both methods work from the command line, but not from motion.

It is not a permissions issue.  I have a directory with the the ownership **motion:motion** that house the scripts, and if I change the value of the trigger to *&gt;/motion/trigger* it will dutifully create an empty file in that directory.

https://ibb.co/4Ntv4xm


I am using a 12v WS2811 dream colored LED strip with three inputs: power, data, ground. It also has two power leads sticking out for an external power supply.


I have added a 12v/1amp power supply with JMT connectors to the extra power leads on the led strip. I verified this is working with another led strip (atleast the power supply connector.) There is 3 leading white LEDs in-between the powersupply cable and JMT connector I left as a power indicator. 

Then I have the 12v power red cable for the strip going from the pi pin 2 (5v power), the ground brown/white going to pin 6 (ground), and the data orange cable going to gpio pin 18.

Then I installed the neopixel library for python correctly, grabbed pin 18 in the code, and try and write data to any led diode but nothing happens at all. I am running the led script as a super user as well, which I read is required.

I got the code / followed this guide exactly except for adding the additional power supply as I believe it is required for my LEDs.

If I unplug it and plug it in again with the button pressed down, it mounts (MacBook - /Volumes/RPI-RP2/) but I've never been able to see anything but INDEX.HTML and INFO\_U2.TXT on it (interestingly saying there is 152.2Mb available!).

raspberry_pi,"Raspbian probably breaking MPV build, I have no clue why.","Hey y'all, I've been trying to build MPV ([mpv.io](https://mpv.io)) for a few months on Raspbian. Every time, it hasn't worked. I've tried using a different Arm based OS (Debian) on the hardware, and it worked fine. Alas, I need to use the Pi's hardware acceleration for stuff, and I like Raspbian more.

I've gotten down the error in question after using Checkinstall, and the exact bit where it breaks can be found at the following Pastebin.

[https://pastebin.com/bHvweBXz](https://pastebin.com/bHvweBXz)

I also used the following guide for compiling MPV for the rpi3

[https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=245574](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=245574)

I've also tried the base way to do it, outlined in MPV documentation, and running it in both root, and not root. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with Raspbian shenanigans, as I said earlier, it worked on Debian with a Raspberry pi 4.

I'd appreciate any help, and I honestly have no clue of what I'm doing at this point."

raspberry_pi,Powering on my (wired-only) Raspberry Pi4 devices jams ALL local 2.4Ghz networks in my area,"This is a weird one, and I've only recently figured out why my cameras were going offline when I do work on my RPi4s. 

When I power up my PoE switch ports and bring my 8-node RPi4 cluster online, *ALL* local 2.4 networks disappear from all devices. Cameras drop offline, Alexa, Roku devices all of them using my 2.4Ghz networks fall off. The moment I power off those RPi4's, the missing 2.4Ghz networks pop back up and IoT devices reconnect almost instantly. 

All of my devices, laptop, mobile, tablet, can also no longer see *my* 2.4Ghz networks, no any of the neighbor's 2.4Ghz networks. They all disappear too. 

I've [read about the HDMI RF bleed on the 10th pixel clock](https://twitter.com/assortedhackery/status/1200056633898029061?s=19), but that's not the case here. I'm not using any displays on these devices, no HDMI output and wifi/bluetooth are disabled on ALL devices in /boot/firmware/config.txt using the correct `dtoverlay` constructs. 

I tried moving my own 2.4Ghz networks from channel 1 through 11, as well as increasing or decreasing the power of the AP on those networks. Nothing has helped. 

I looked into the `hdmi_timings` and played around with some samples (even though I'm not using HDMI at all on these), same story. The moment the RPi4's power up, they RF jam all local 2.4 frequencies. ***ALL of them***. 

These RPi4's are all 100% PoE powered, no USB-C, no WiFi, no Bluetooth. 

I'm at a loss as to what chip on these devices could oscillate at whatever frequency is jamming everything else in my local area. 

I also confirmed that this exact same symptom affects my [Pi4-400](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/) as well. The moment I power that up, 2.4Ghz goes down too. 

What am I missing?"

I have my first gen Model B+ Raspberry Pi working  as a NAT and TorBox. I'm wondering how much bandwidth it spends overnight when I leave it doing its thing. And then it occurred to me, it doesn't have a network-manager applet on the panel. I mean, it does have a network CONNECTION INTERFACE available to choose wifi or ethernet, but no traffic monitoring live report.

I was told to delete the applet that comes with the stock Raspberry Pi OS and install network-manager, which I did but upon reboot there isn't anything new in panel applets to add.

So my question is this, is there an applet or a terminal command (I also tried htop in the terminal, couldn't find any network-traffic related info) that I could try in order to track down how much bandwidth my Pi has been using?

raspberry_pi,Started making a UI library for PICO,"Evening all, showing some progress I have made with my UI library that I have been working on! 

The end goal of this is for it to replicate commonly used features in other PC libraries, such as [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), but optimized for the raspberry PI.

it is currently capable of rendering basic shapes and text with padding, offsets, scales, etc. It is also completely independent from the screen drivers, it will just present the final image as a char array for you to feed to the screen. 

*Processing img pt94szjy4je61...*

Some plans for the project are

* Multicore support to offload UI onto a different thread
* Navigation: to allow you to flick through the screen items and select them
* Intermidiate UI support
* Image (Data must be packed into header like in this [PICO example](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/st7789_lcd/raspberry_256x256_rgb565.h)) and Animation support"

raspberry_pi,Need Help For RP2040 Neopixel Library,"I am trying to make a MicroPython Library for Raspberry Pi Pico to drive Neopixel (WS2812) LEDs with PIO.

My Code:

[GitHub](https://github.com/shreyask21/neopixel_rp2040/blob/main/neopixel_rp2040.py)

The Problem:   

All of the code works except the brightness part. When I change brightness of the LED by passing the reduced RGB values directly it works fine, but when I change the RGB value with brightness modifier random colors appear instead of changing the brightness of the NeoPixel.

What I am trying to achieve:

    Red = 0xFF
    Green = 0x00
    Blue = 0xFF
    RGB_Result_A = Red&lt;&lt;16 | Green&lt;&lt;8 | Blue
    # Resulting Color Would be Magenta (0xFF00FF)
    
    Brightness = 0.5 # Half Brightness i.e. 1/2
    # Halving R,G,B values
    RGB_Result_B = (Brightness*(R))&lt;&lt;16 | (Brightness*Green)&lt;&lt;8 | (Brightness*Blue)
    # So the result should be (0x800080) less bright magenta

But when I do that I get different colors instead of brightness reduction.

The code used for testing:

    import utime
    import neopixel_rp2040
    
    led = neopixel_rp2040.neopixel(LEDS=2, PIN=22)
    
    led.set() # Turn on all LEDs to white
    
    brightnessArr = [(10-x/10.0) for x in range(11)]
        # brightnessArr = [1.0, 0.9, ... 0]
    for i in range(11):
        led.setBrightness(BRIGHTNESS=brightnessArr[i])
        utime.sleep(0.5)

This is my first time writing libraries for MicroPython and I am not experienced with MicroPython either, so any suggestions are welcome.

raspberry_pi,Kids keyboard not working with Raspberry Pi 3,"I wanted to create a safe setup for kids to bash the keyboard on a Raspberry Pi. 

Unfortunately the keyboard I got (see pic) doesn't seem to work straight away. I booted the Pi with the keyboard plugged in, the power light comes on but otherwise doesn't work.

I tried the keyboard with a windows laptop and it works fine. I got it off Ebay, it doesn't seem to have much to identify it, on the back it says MODEL NO: EL1, SKU NO: EL1/COL/LC, SERIAL NO: 123929.

Any help greatly appreciated by me and child looking sadly at a non-functioning keyboard."

raspberry_pi,Its insane what a Raspberry Pi can do - RPI as a router with VPN/DoH/Adblock,"Im actually amazed what a little raspberry pi can do nowadays. Ive got myself a RPI 4 with 4GB to get it running as a router/AP behind my modem ISP. I tried OpenWRT but i had too many problems with it, so i decided to install Raspbian and configure everything myself.

Plugged in an USB to Ethernet adapter, instantly recognized. Same with an USB WIFI Adapter.

Currently im running:
-&gt; OpenVPN to auto connect to my VPN provider

-&gt; DNS-Over-HTTPS via Cloudflare

-&gt; Pi-Hole with GUI for Adblocking

-&gt; USB WIFI as an Access Point

eth1 (USB Ethernet) + wlan1 (USB Wifi) are bridged, i have NAT active so the internal raspberry ethernet (eth0) routes everything to the bridged interface which allows me to connect any device via LAN or WIFI to my RPI and have VPN/secure DNS/adblock in my own network.

Everything works perfectly and the best thing pi-hole shows almost no load on the CPU with temps around 40c (rpi in a case with a fan).

Its so satisfying when everything works and you still have ressources to install more, lol."

raspberry_pi,I want to use a raspberry pi to broadcast my usb record player as online radio to let friends and family listen,"I’ve tried icecast but I can’t get it to either run or I can’t get access via local host:8000/admin.

raspberry_pi,Best practices for building a computer lab.,"There is a ton of information out there, but i'm trying to avoid some pitfalls if possible. The scenario is to build a computer lab for a community centre where kids and adults would have access to computers. They would be used for browsing only, so no concern of running Word etc. locally.

Ideally, the environment should be zero/low maintenance with the ability to have a user account that doesn't have admin rights. If there was a way to allow people to create a user account, that would be awesome.

Any suggestions or ideas welcome."

raspberry_pi,Pico project using loads of LEDs,"I've got my hands on a Pico and have written a MicroPython program that's related to music theory. It uses 12 LEDs, one per musical note (A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G). This all works perfectly and I can turn each one on and off at will using the GPIO pins.

Howver, I want to mutiply this so that I can control multiple octaves worth of notes - perhaps 4 octaves, so 48 indivual LEDs. I note there are only 20ish GPIO pins on the Pico, so I wouldn't be able to control each one individually. I've started looking at external shift register ICs for this - is this the right path to go down, or is there a easier way I've missed?

Alternatively, I could tie all of the LEDs for each note together, so when F# is on, all of the F#s are on, this woud need each GPIO pin to light up 4 or 5 LEDs. Would the piso be able to handle this, especially when all (48?) LEDs were on at the same time? Is it better to use a transistor to power these? Or again, is there a better way I've missed?

Thanks in advance for any ideas."
raspberry_pi,"I'm trying to stream my bird box cam to youtube, why does my pi randomly stop streaming after several hours?","Firstly, I am far from an expert, I have spent hours working out for myself how to do this. I think I understand what each seperate part of my code is doing, but no amount of searching is helping me with this problem.

I have a nice live stream set up, but my pi randomly stops the stream after several hours. Sometimes 3 or 4 hours sometimes 12 or 15 hours.

I would be grateful for anywhere I could look to fix my problem. Is there an error code I could search for somewhere within my pi that might tell me where the problem is?

I have a raspberry pi 3b+ using an official power supply, good wifi connection, an auto ir switching camera attached to the board, and a microphone attached via a cheapo usb soundcard. The whole kit is mounted inside the removable top section of a bird box which I made especially for this job.

This is the code I am using:

raspivid --nopreview -md 4 -w 1280 -h 720 -fps 15 -t 0 -b 2500000 -g 30 -n -o - |  ffmpeg -y -xerror -thread_queue_size 32K -f h264 -r 15 -itsoffset 0 -i - -f alsa -ar 11025 -itsoffset 5.5 -async 1 -ac 1 -thread_queue_size 128K -i hw:1,0 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -async 1  -c:v copy  -f flv -flags:v +global_header -rtmp_buffer 10000 -r 15 -async 1 rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

If there is any interest I will make a thread of how I constructed it, and of course post a link to the live stream. It really is fascinating to watch a pair of birds lay eggs, hatch them, and watch them raise their young. I have done this for many years, but only recently tried to set up a live stream.

Thanks in advance :)"

I tried mp4, mov and youtube urls and it only shows a yellow line through the timeline (indicating buffering). I tried looking in Google but i didnt find anything, so i guess it must be my fault.

raspberry_pi,can't flash 128 GB micro SSD,"Heyo Peeps,

Believe me I tried to find a solution before bothering you with a question I am sure has been asked before (though I didn't find one on here with the keywords I tried).

Following Issue. Whenever I try to flash my 128 GB micro SSD with any image, be it debian, raspbian or gentoo it fails without fail. ha. My 32 GB micro SSD however flashes first try with the same images.

Things I've tried:

1. Flash Disk with balena etcher (Error. 1 Failed Target)
2. Format Disk to fat32
3. create partitions on the disk with one being only 32GB, also fat32 (Didn't work as etcher seems to see them as a single drive anyways)
4. use WIN32Diskimager instead, throws me the Error (cyclic redundancy check)
5. tried to fix the ssd with chkdsk which didn't find any issues on the micro ssd
6. retry flashing it multiple times, with the result of the process failing anywhere from 5% in to 50% in
7. flash the 32 GB one again to make sure its not the programs fault

At this point I am out of Ideas. I believe I managed to flash gentoo on it a few days ago, and the problems started when I tried to flash another iso on it, but at this point I don't trust my memory. maybe the Hardware itself is just faulty and etcher encounters an error I can't see. I remember using it in my old LG G4 as music storage space. I also remember that the music on there tended to corrupt over time, meaning some songs would skip half way trough.  


I'd appreciate any form of help a lot."

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/l4qks4/new_user_looking_to_add_a_rechargeable_battery_to/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/).
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?

18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not.

For a fun project I decided to use a RPi Zero W, an old laptop LED/LCD and a 40 pin controller to HDMI board and mount it inside a picture frame. When I was hanging it up a thought crossed my mind about the safety of it. While i'm confident that the RPi won't catch fire should I be worried that the circuit board of the controller or the display itself won't? Should I also try to wrap it in an antistatic bag on the back of the digital picture frame? While this project should have been simple in the first place as I was just making a large 21 inch picture frame it's now begun to worry me. 

The controller I used is this one: [https://www.amazon.com/VSDISPLAY-Controller-LP140WH1-BT140XW02-Backlight/dp/B01N5J57YP/ref=sr\_1\_2?crid=2JESBDROWKM65&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=40+pin+lcd+connector&amp;qid=1611527878&amp;sprefix=40+pin+l%2Caps%2C195&amp;sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/VSDISPLAY-Controller-LP140WH1-BT140XW02-Backlight/dp/B01N5J57YP/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2JESBDROWKM65&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=40+pin+lcd+connector&amp;qid=1611527878&amp;sprefix=40+pin+l%2Caps%2C195&amp;sr=8-2)

raspberry_pi,Pico Programmable IO data flow,"I have been trying to work out how to take in data using the Programmable IO (PIO) feature on the Pico and how I can connect it to the Direct Memory Access (DMA) system, so I can use it for taking data from a camera module like the OV7670.

I've read the PIO sections in the RP2040 (the microcontroller itself) datasheet, the Python SDK and the C/C++ SDK, but am struggling to understand how data flows through the system. The C/C++ SDK includes an example of using the PIO with DMA but it doesn't describe the flow at a high level and I'm still a beginner with C so am struggling to understand it.

 From my understanding so far, this is how it works for input:
GPIO -&gt; Input Shift Register (ISR) using IN command -&gt; RX FIFO using PUSH command (or seemingly automatically and bypassing the ISR if using autopush) -&gt; somewhere in the system, I assume RAM.

What I'm wondering is where it ends up at that last step and how you would link the DMA system into the chain so you can pass the data to something like an SD card. It would need to be formatted into a standard image format like bitmap before going to the SD card though, so where would it be held while that manipulation is being done?"

Unfortunately I have been having some issues I can't find a source for online.  
1. The device doesn't show up on either PC or Laptop as USB Mass Storage device as it did before I first uploaded an example program last night (I believe the Hello World example). This doesn't change as long as I hold down BOOTSEL.  
2. The device only shows up in ""Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices"" with limited information under the name ""Pico"".  
3. There are two pins that are held high: RUN and ADC\_VREF, all others are at 0.

This is about as much information as I have, and I come to one of two conclusions: The device is properly bricked after I uploaded the first program incorrectly, OR the Bootsel button is broken, note I did not have to hold it down the first time to upload as it was already under My PC.

If anyone has any information, or can help me out, please let me know!

Many thanks"

Dear members of the forum, I recently bought a Raspberry Pi3 model B and made it a retro console, but that's not the issue. Yesterday evening I had an idea: We have a heating system which consists of 2 ovens (a gas oven and a wood oven and photovoltaic on the roof) the trick is that the wood oven should take over the heating and the gas oven only turns on when the boiler of the wood stove has fallen below a certain temperature. This also works very well, since a few weeks we have even had a kind of visualization, namely an LED lights up in the apartment and in the workshop below, after which the gas stove switches on shortly afterwards. This lamp lights up until you switch on the refueling mode on the wood stove, after which the gas stove goes out immediately. Now I had the idea whether it would not be possible to send an automated message to our phones with a raspberry (and a micro controller?) Because we are not always close to the lights and the gas stove is significantly more expensive than the wood stove Ask if something like that is possible that if the light is on for more than 30 seconds a message is sent. I'm always open to questions Please excuse my poor spelling. I have major problems with writing correctly due to illness Thank you for reading this post so far With best regards Cervanthes"

raspberry_pi,Power failures and data corruption (NAS build)?,"How well does an RPI 4 configured to run a RAID1 NAS handle a power outage?

Data corruption was always a fear when running servers for business and so I used UPSes for protection.

The little RPI NAS I'm thinking of cooking up will be for home.  Still, losing any of my own data would be annoying.  I would have backups so it's not the end of the world.  Perhaps I'd lose that day's data?  Still annoying.

The storage devices would likely be 2 x 8TB standalone external hard drives connected via the 2 USB 3 ports.   Though I see that people are using USB hubs to add more devices and maybe that will be how I connect the drives so that in the future I can add more to the NAS.

Can I safely rely on all this simply plugged into fairly reliable city power?  By ""fairly reliable"" I mean that the number of outages at home in the last 20 years can be counted on the fingers of 1 hand.  (Though all it takes is one at an inopportune time perhaps...?)

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pico silicon is... huge?,"[This blog post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/) says that the Pico's silicone is 2 mm² at 40 nm and is built around 2 Cortex-M0 cores. [Intel claims](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productIds=37147) that it was able to etch around 5.5 million transistors per 2 mm² of silicon using its 45 nm process. [This post](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/288336/transistors-count-of-microcontrollers) says that a Cortex-M0 core can be made of as little as 48,000 transistors.

These number clearly don't add up, why is Pico's silicon so large? It's not a bad thing, I'm just curious."

raspberry_pi,TIL About the Magic Sysrq Key,"Ok, maybe I'm late to the game on this one but I'm still kind of new to all this.

I stumbled across this magic button in a comment on r/pihole while trying to troubleshoot a crashing rpi0w. Not sure yet if it'll actually help in my situation but i figure if i didn't know about it, there's gotta be other noobs out there who also don't know about it. Well, now you do. You're welcome 😌.

Here's a pretty detailed explanation of how to use it and what it does. Full thread can be found [here](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=263055).

////////////////////

REISUB procedure:
Hold down the Alt and SysRq (Print Screen) keys, and enter r e i s u b
On my computer I can hold down Alt and tap the SysRq key, then enter reisub.
On some computers it has to be Shift-Alt and tap the SysRq key. Or it can be Ctrl-Alt and SysRq.
Laptops may require you to hold down the function key (fn) along with alt and sysrq.

Pause after each key to give the computer time to compute. (particularly after e, i, and s.)

Technical details:
r = unRaw (take control of keyboard back from X),
e = tErminate (send SIGTERM to all processes, allowing them to terminate gracefully),
i = kIll (send SIGKILL to all processes, forcing them to terminate immediately),
s = Sync (flush data to disk),
u = Unmount (remount all filesystems read-only),
b = reBoot.

I'm having problems setting up a headless Raspberrry Pi Zero with ssh access. Specifically, I get the error ""touch: cannot touch 'ssh': Read-only file system"" when trying to run \`touch ssh\` in the ""boot"" directory

**My Steps**

\- Downloaded the ""Rasberry Pi Desktop"" iso from here: [https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/)

\- Plugged in a microSD card, via an adapter, into my Thinkpad computer ( running Fedora )

\- Moved the downloaded Raspberry iso onto that microSD card.

\- cd'd into the microSD card. In my case \`cd /run/media/myusername/Debian RPD M-A 1 /\`

\- cd'd into the boot folder within the Raspberry Pi iso image. \`cd boot\`

\- Ran the command \`touch ssh\` 

\- The above command errors with \`touch: cannot touch 'ssh': Read-only file system\`

**Questions**

\- How do I add the blank ssh file given the problems above? I've already tried to mount the .iso file directly to my computer as writable. That does not work either."

raspberry_pi,Overclocking the Pi 4 and I have some questions,"So, I've got a Pi 4 with 8GB of ram running Ubuntu Desktop 20.10.  I figured it was time to try overclocking.  I'm using the [Argon ONE V2 Case](https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-v-2-case-for-raspberry-pi-5.html).  I've read various guides online, and I know the process to overclock a Pi 4 but, I've got a few questions.  

The config file is located at /boot/firmware/config.txt in Ubuntu instead of /boot/config.txt in Raspberry Pi OS.  Here's the default contents of it:

    [pi4]
    max_framebuffers=2
    
    [all]
    arm_64bit=1
    kernel=vmlinuz
    cmdline=cmdline.txt
    initramfs initrd.img followkernel
    
    # Enable the audio output, I2C and SPI interfaces on the GPIO header
    dtparam=audio=on
    dtparam=i2c_arm=on
    dtparam=spi=on
    
    # Enable the FKMS (""Fake"" KMS) graphics overlay, enable the camera     firmware
    # and allocate 128Mb to the GPU memory
    dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
    gpu_mem=128
    start_x=1
    
    # Comment out the following line if the edges of the desktop appear outside
    # the edges of your display
    disable_overscan=1
    
    # If you have issues with audio, you may try uncommenting the following line
    # which forces the HDMI output into HDMI mode instead of DVI (which doesn't
    # support audio output)
    #hdmi_drive=2
    
    # If you have a CM4, uncomment the following line to enable the USB2 outputs
    # on the IO board (assuming your CM4 is plugged into such a board)
    #dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host

Based on what I've read online, there's are some default settings missing.  Is there anything of importance that I should add while editing this to overclock?

This is what I plan on modifying/adding:
    
    [pi4]
    arm_freq=2100
    gpu_freq=750
    over_voltage=6
    gpu_mem=1024

Can I just replace gpu_mem=128 with gpu_mem=1024 and only add the top 3 additions to the pi4 section?  Can I allocate more that 1GB to the GPU memory?  This is the first time that I've overclocked anything."

raspberry_pi,Pi Web Camera - Time being stretched out (1 sec of motion = 2 sec of video),"I have a Pi Zero W that I have hooked to a Pi Camera that runs a local website I can check to monitor a CNC machine. I am using this [code on git](https://github.com/patrickfuller/camp). But when I run it, and especially if I run it at high video quality, the Camera lags.  My lag I mean that time is stretched not that it is mere latency.  If I hold my hand up for 1 second, the camera will show me with my hand up for 2 seconds. It gets worse and worse the longer you watch. It is completely unusable. If I set it to the lowest video quality it works ok but the frame rate is really bad. This is the case on two different Pis, different places in the house, next to a router, two different cameras.  Any help appreciated.

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi Camera HQ still has DRM (ATSHA204A),"It's an unfortunate fact that the Pi Camera v2 contains DRM that prevents other companies from making clones of it. It's the only reason I haven't purchased anything from the RPi Foundation since the Pi 2, since I try to avoid products that implement DRM.

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed the Pi Camera HQ and became interested in it, but I couldn't find if the DRM was still there. The DRM on the Pi Camera v2 is implemented using a Microchip ATSHA204A. I've started looking at the  schematic of the Pi Camera HQ (available at [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/camera/schematics/rpi\_SCH\_HQcamera\_1p0.pdf](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/camera/schematics/rpi_SCH_HQcamera_1p0.pdf)) and the ATSHA204A is still there on page 3 in the left bottom corner, so unfortunately the new camera still has the DRM."

We're developing a new device based on Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module.

We need a USB OTG (2.0/3.0) controller that on one side provides host and device functionality, depending on what was plugged in, and on the other side sits on a PCIe bus. Does it even exist ? Speed is not very critical, but the OTG part is !

The Broadcom BCM2711 chip includes one USB 2.0 OTG, but we need several, and totally independent USB OTG controllers (USB hub chip will not work, because it is a host-only functionality)

NOTE: USB 2.0 OTG was renamed into a Dual-Role device in USB 3.0.

All I was able to find are controller intellectual property blocks to be integrated into chips -or- Host-only controllers that can sit on PCIe. (like VIA VLI 805 USB 3.0, but host-only controller)

Today I wanted to test a certain application how well it would run on a pi.I grepped a pi 2 and created a fresh installation. I thought it would run well on this, but it was very laggy. I opened up the raspberry pi configuration tool GUI and set it to ""high"" mode with a bit more video memory. It didn't help.

After that I shut it off and moved the sd card to a pi 3. Immediately after boot a temperature icon showed up. Googled the command to show the temperature and after I figured that out it showed 103 degrees!!!!. Then the screen went black and pi won't turn on anymore..

Checked it and 3.3v and GND are shorted.. I've used this pi3 for more project in the past but it's weird it would suddenly overheat and kill itself. I also don't really get why it is not protected against this?

Is there anything I can do to fix this? Is this some kind of protection?

raspberry_pi,Advice needed for online data logger,"I'm building my first major project using a Raspberry Pi having taught myself the basics of Python, but I'm not sure of the best method to set up the next step.

The project is to have a Raspberry Pi act as a logger: collecting data from sensors, recording those to spreadsheets, backing those up to an online store (I'm using Dropbox). All of those parts I've got working using a Python script that I've written (fairly inexpertly, but it works!).

The next step is having either a single logger, or hopefully several of these loggers available for a live view over the internet on a webpage that anyone can visit. This is where I need the advice, since I'm looking at some options and don't know which way to go.

I figure I might be able to set up the Pi as a web server to host a simple page with charts of the data, but that looks fairly complex. I could use Node Red, which looks much more user friendly, although it uses JavaScript which I'm not familiar with, and I figure it's going to take a while to learn Node Red's ins and outs too. Perhaps I could use a separate Pi to receive MQTT data from many loggers and host a webpage on *that* to put the data of many loggers together in one place, or maybe there's a service that would do that for me.

Any advice on how best to proceed would be great, since I'm kinda daunted by all the options, and I don't want to spend ages going down one rabbit hole only to find there's a better, simpler option out there.

raspberry_pi,2021 Jan 18 Stickied 𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊 thread - Boot problems? Display problems? Networking problems? Need ideas? Get help with these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kvepbj/2021_jan_11_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Some power supplies require negotiation to use the higher amperage, which the Pi does not do.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

Watching Youtube  
Watching Stream In Browser  
Watching mkv or mp4 movies.  


I noticed too late that watching videos inside a browser isn't here yet. Very choppy, lot of tearing etc.

raspberry_pi,Pi 400 - what can I really use it for?,"A couple years ago I thought about a bare-bones Pi and a touchscreen to do amazing things as a car computer (in a '90s car I own), but I never followed through on it because 2-DIN plug-n-play head units with Android integration got really cheap and took the option off the table. But then my dad bought me a Pi-400...

***I've done some research*** using the FAQ, and the best answer I've seen was from /u/throwywayradeon who pointed out that it's a modern ZX-Spectrum, (which I had back in the '80s!). But that's not the use-case for me - and I apologise if that sounds ungrateful to my dad, who just bought the *best* of something that he knew would interest me. 

Now, I know that some projects might find an integrated keyboard to be useful. But the 400's planform is really restricting. 

Should I just give this 400 to my niece, and buy a 4B/4b+ for myself? Or are there some Pi-400 projects that might be worthwhile around the house? Please help - I'm kind of lost and I don't want to waste this lovely little thing."

Apparently it was resolved at some point, because I never had the problem before, but it's back.

The symptoms are a horrid distortion like a ring mod, plus being played at the wrong sample rate, almost like what you might expect if you inserted a zero in between every sample or something.

Supplying -o2 fixes it.  If you get some crap about an unrecognized character, move the -o2 to the end, even if it seems like your syntax was perfectly good."

raspberry_pi,RPi4 NAS NTFS ext. Drive Slow Speed,"RPi4 is the only non-windows system I use so I kept NTFS as I may use elsewhere the external drive for one reason or another. I get around 35/41 mb/s while getting 105mb on iperf3. I don't expect to get same numbers but the difference is huge. I read around that ext3/4 would really make a difference but the drive wouldn't be plug and play on windows systems as I would have to use other programs to mount it (Windows 10 systems). Is the information I found wrong? Is there another filesystem that would provide greater speed on RPi while working on Windows?

raspberry_pi,"For those interested in Audio-Dsp and Python, I just released a package","Hi all,  
over  the past year I got back into coding after 6 years in the audio  industry. I worked on an audio effects python library for processing  audio files and streams for the past 6 months. It actually works quite  well with a few bugs remaining and I would just like to share it and  maybe get some feedback. I think it is cool, because the only dependency  is numpy and you can actually see whats happens with your arrays, so  nearly no blackboxing takes place. I mainly used numpy and with some  tricks managed to stay  below 1.0 millisecond for most processors with a  buffer size of 512, so you can actually use most of them in real-time  with pyaudio.

Also, I released it under the MIT licence, so feel free to use it in any way you want.

There  are quite a few effects I managed to implement and it is one of those  resources I wish I had a year ago, just to see different fx in action in  a simplified manner. It might also be useful for super easy  batch-processing of audio data-sets for CNNs, prototyping vst plugins or  do fun stuff with your raspberry pi. Here is the Git if anyone is  interested:

raspberry_pi,WindowSense - A Python IoT Project on Raspberry Pi &amp; Sense HAT with Nest Thermostat &amp; OpenWeatherMap Integration,"# My Story

Not long after COVID-19 began to reshape our lives I found myself with lots of time at home  
and an itch to start a new indoor hobby.  Intrigued by a tech article about someone's Raspberry Pi project, I went down the rabbit hole and soon bought one of my own.  Aside from one semester of C++ in college 15 years ago, however, I had minimal experience with computer programming, so I set out to learn on my own.  


This is my first original project creation after going through a Raspberry Pi tutorial book, completing the Python 3 course at Codecademy, much self-directed learning by Googling stuff, and learning how to design &amp; print 3D models.  The GitHub repo attempts to pay forward a small fraction of the help I have received from others by providing a collection of learning resources I've used along my journey.

&gt;""Someone ought to open up a window!"" --Congress, 1776 The Musical

  
Get a sense of when to open the windows for fresh air with WindowSense. Set the thermostat for comfort and save money on heating and cooling by letting in the breeze at the best times.

&amp;#x200B;

WindowSense integrates the temperature forecast with Nest thermostat comfort settings to visualize when the outside air will be just right to throw open the windows for fresh air that won't make the house too hot or cold.

&amp;#x200B;

The RGB LED matrix display uses a rainbow of colors to signal how the temperature will change over the next eight hours, so you can plan ahead and maximize your home's comfort and efficiency.  


# The Inspiration

*Processing img nkdr3oy2lpb61...*

There's something special about air that's just the right temperature such that you can't feel it at all.  Last fall, when the days were still warm and the nights getting cold, my wife and I were trying to open the windows as much as possible for fresh air. However, as the resident steward of the thermostat,  
I also wanted to make sure we weren't letting in hot late-afternoon air or leaving the windows open too long and allowing the house to get cold from the chilly, nighttime air.  Depending on the day, there was sometimes a narrow window of opportunity to let in fresh air that would feel just right and not waste energy.  So the idea was born to create a smart device to tell us when it would be comfortable--and efficient--to throw open the windows for a cross-breeze.  Now it lives permanently next to our front window where it's visible from most of the first floor.  


# The WindowSense Display

[A visual guide to how WindowSense dynamically graphs the temperature forecasts relative to thermostat set points.](https://preview.redd.it/mgg4dlialpb61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3f9d33472e72a9d9c4c19e4e3a859915345562b)

WindowSense uses a stylized graph in a spectrum of colors to show when it will be cold, warm, or comfortable outside.  The 8x8 RGB LED matrix represents eight hours of forecasts, with now on the left and the next seven hours from left to right.  


The thermostat's comfort range, as defined by the heating and cooling setpoint, is represented by  
the middle two rows in green.  Outside temps closer to the top of the comfort range place the green square higher; cooler temps closer to the bottom of the comfort range place it lower.  


Each row of the graph represents steps of equal size, to give a relative impression of how much colder or hotter it is outside than you would want it to be in your home.  If your comfort range is heat to 65F &amp; cool to 75F, for example, then each block is 5 degrees.  Additionally, if the forecast will be below freezing, the bottom row will turn white to indicate the possibility of snow &amp; ice.  


With this information available at a glance, it is easy to know when you can open windows to be comfortable and efficient.  You can also plan for the day, see the ebb and flow of daily temperatures, and prepare your home or garden if temperatures will drop below freezing.  


# How It Works

  
[WindowSense on GitHub](https://github.com/SilentRhetoric/WindowSense)  


WindowSense runs as a Python script on an internet-connected Raspberry Pi and uses a few functions:  


\* Reading the Nest thermostat's heat &amp; cool setpoints via Google's Device Access API  
\* Getting the weather forecast from OpenWeatherMap's API using the PyOWM library  
\* Dynamically calculating and drawing a graph that relates the outside temps to your indoor comfort settings  
\* Interactive button commands, including:  
 \- Ambient temp &amp; humidity readout from the Nest  
 \- Thermostat heat &amp; cool setpoint readouts  
 \- LED brightness adjustment  
 \- Manual forecast &amp; graph refresh  
 \- A safe shutdown process  


Additionally, temperature forecast data is written to a .csv file for future data analysis, and the Nest thermostat traits are written to a JSON file to allow investigation of deeper integration opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

WindowSense runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero WH with a Sense HAT, and both are mounted inside a custom 3D-printed case.  With a minimalist design and printed with Protopasta's Matte Fiber White HTPLA, the case has an earthy texture that blends in with analog surroundings and decor.  


The WindowSense case was designed parametrically in Fusion 360.  The mounting hole dimensions of the Pi Zero and Sense HAT were used as fixed construction guidelines around which  
the case is deployed around the electronics as snugly as practicable.  


The two halves of the case snap together with a friction fit as a satisfying click.  A small window in the shape of the WindowSense ""logo"" allows a peek at the PCBs inside and the ability to see the Raspberry Pi's power LED.  A decorative joystick cover can be attached to the Sense HAT's five-way joystick button so that it can be operated through the case.  


The internal standoffs have been designed to hold the combined Zero + HAT just right and allow mounting with just four screws and two spacers. The USB power cable is routed internally to redirect it for a straight exit out the bottom of the case, which allows for the flat cable to be oriented downward, for wall mounting, or backward, for tabletop use.  An additional slot at the bottom edge makes it easy to pop open the case by inserting a flathead screwdriver and giving a gentle twist.

# Request for Feedback

As this is a learning project for me, I am open to your feedback on all aspects of the project, from the Python script to the case design and everything in between.  I expect I will learn a dozen things from your comments here!

Some ideas I have for next steps are:

* Incorporating logging into the code to help with debugging as complexity increases
* Graceful exception handling and recovery for internet outages, etc.
* Refining the code as my understanding of class/module design improves
* A web interface or mobile app integration with notifications"

raspberry_pi,Waking up a monitor connecting to HDMI port when a motion sensor goes off?,"Hi all. 

So I'm doing a magic mirror project as my first pi project (original I know) but I'm using a TV as my monitor, not wanting to waste power I only want it to turn on when a PIR sensor attached to the GPIO pins detects movement. 

I've set up the PIR sensor already and got it to what I want, but how would I actually do about turning the TV on and off or putting it on standby when know movement is detected?

Have had a look online but not found anything that has explained it to me. Bear in mind I'm mentally about 5 years old when it comes to most of the stuff on this sub. 

Thanks in advance!"

raspberry_pi,"I disabled fake-hwclock to use an RTC, but then realized that I'm only using the RTC within the scope of my python app. Should I reenable fake-hwclock?","I followed [this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time) to switch the system over to the RTC (ds3231). Then I tried to use the python library to read and write to it, only to find out it was 'busy.'

Then it clicked that I don't have to have the RTC synced to the system clock at all. In fact, it shouldn't be synced so the user can set the time and not have it click back when it connects to the internet (the person this is for likes to set his clocks ahead so he's early to stuff). 

So I undid the dtoverlay changes and my python code worked to display whatever time I set the RCT to, and it's holding that time consistently. 

But now linux can't keep time. Every time I reboot, it changes a little more. So here are my questions:

1. Does it matter?
2. Should I reenable fake-hwclock just to let the system do it's thing? Or will that still somehow mess with the RTC even though the only thing that's supposed to be talking to it is my clock app?"

\# My setup: Raspberry Pi OS on Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM) + 128GB Samsung EVO+ MicroSD card

&amp;#x200B;

\# This is under the assumption you are NOT SSH/remote into Raspberry Pi OS

&amp;#x200B;

\# 1) Open terminal window on Raspberry Pi OS

&amp;#x200B;

\# 2) You may want to update Python and IDLE:

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt update

&amp;#x200B;

\# (As of today I have Python 3.7.3)

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt install python3 idle3

&amp;#x200B;

\# (Updating IDLE is optional since everything is happening inside terminal)

&amp;#x200B;

\# 3) Install/update pip:

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt install python3-pip

&amp;#x200B;

\# 4) Install/update virtualenv:

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt install virtualenv python3-virtualenv –y

&amp;#x200B;

\# 5) Create a virtual environment (env) called 'testpip' (you can name it whatever):

&amp;#x200B;

virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 testpipsource testpip/bin/activate

&amp;#x200B;

\# 6) Your prompt should go from ""pi@raspberrypi"" --&gt; ""(testpip) pi@raspberrypi""

&amp;#x200B;

\# (Indicates you are inside the virtualenv 'testpip' that you created)

&amp;#x200B;

\# 7) Inside the virtualenv 'testpip' we install the various packages and libraries to use within the 'testpip' virtualenv (only)

&amp;#x200B;

\# 8) For instance if you want scipy (which will also install numpy):

&amp;#x200B;

pip install scipy

&amp;#x200B;

\# 9) The following commands install Tensorflow and various other dependencies to make it run:

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt-get install -y libhdf5-dev libc-ares-dev libeigen3-dev

&amp;#x200B;

python3 -m pip install keras\_applications==1.0.8 --no-deps

&amp;#x200B;

python3 -m pip install keras\_preprocessing==1.1.0 --no-deps

&amp;#x200B;

python3 -m pip install h5py==2.9.0

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt-get install -y openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev

&amp;#x200B;

python3 -m pip install -U six wheel mock

&amp;#x200B;

\# 10) These steps are specific to getting Tensorflow 1.13.1

&amp;#x200B;

\# (which works with gpt2client, unsure if any slightly newer versions of Tensorflow will work.

&amp;#x200B;

\# The gpt2client package states that 2.0 and newer don’t.)

&amp;#x200B;

\# a) Go to this website: [https://www.piwheels.org/project/tensorflow/#install](https://www.piwheels.org/project/tensorflow/#install)

&amp;#x200B;

\# b) Scroll down to find the 1.13.1 version of Tensorflow and click the blue box

&amp;#x200B;

\# c) Copy the link for the ""tensorflow-1.13.1-cp37-none-linux\_armv7l.whl"" file

&amp;#x200B;

\# d) In terminal type:wget (insert copied link here)

&amp;#x200B;

\# e) Uninstall previous versions of Tensorflow (if you have any):

&amp;#x200B;

python3 -m pip uninstall tensorflow

&amp;#x200B;

\# f) Since we are in a virtual environment, type:

&amp;#x200B;

pip install tensorflow==1.13.1

&amp;#x200B;

\# 11) Close terminal window and then open a new terminal window:

&amp;#x200B;

cd testpip

&amp;#x200B;

\# (or whatever you named your virtualenv that we created earlier)

&amp;#x200B;

source bin/activate

&amp;#x200B;

\# prompt should change ""pi@raspberrypi"" --&gt; ""(testpip) pi@raspberrypi""

&amp;#x200B;

\# 12) Let's go through some checks:

&amp;#x200B;

\# a) Type and enter:

&amp;#x200B;

python3

&amp;#x200B;

\# (Displays various info and opens Python interpreter within Terminal)

&amp;#x200B;

\# b) The previous step will also change your prompt to become ""&gt;&gt;&gt;""

&amp;#x200B;

\# c) Type and enter:import tensorflow

&amp;#x200B;

\# (There will be lots of warnings and stuff but another ""&gt;&gt;&gt;"" should show up)

&amp;#x200B;

\# d) double check tensorflow version with:tensorflow.\_\_version\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

\# You should see: ‘1.13.1’

&amp;#x200B;

\# (Note that there are 2 ""\_"" in front and after the word 'version')

&amp;#x200B;

\# 12) a) Now exit the Python interpreter with:

&amp;#x200B;

exit()

&amp;#x200B;

\# b) In 'testpip' virtualenv, install the GPT2Client:

&amp;#x200B;

pip install gpt2-client

&amp;#x200B;

\# c) Once done downloading and installing (hopefully successfully), type:

&amp;#x200B;

python3

&amp;#x200B;

\# 13) a) Now back inside the Python interpreter we will re-check everything:

&amp;#x200B;

import tensorflow

&amp;#x200B;

tensorflow.\_\_version\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

\# (\_ \_version\_ \_ without the spaces between each ""\_"") --&gt; again should display: '1.13.1'

&amp;#x200B;

\# b) Type:from gpt2\_client import GPT2Client

&amp;#x200B;

\# c) Then type:

&amp;#x200B;

gpt2 = GPT2Client('345M')

&amp;#x200B;

\# (The less ram you have you may want to use a smaller model; I have 4gb ram)

&amp;#x200B;

\# (Other model options are '117M', '774M' or the largest at '1558M')

&amp;#x200B;

\# d) Now type:

&amp;#x200B;

gpt2.generate(interactive=True)

&amp;#x200B;

\# (Asks the user for a prompt but it takes some time before it asks for the prompt)

&amp;#x200B;

\# This is the prompt I used. It’s the same prompt used in the reddit post that inspired me (link below) to get this whole process working and written down:

&amp;#x200B;

\# ""I've worked hard to create this disk image for folks who want to experiment so they can get a working copy of GPT-2.# Now I hope to see some inspiring results, and I hope you'll all share""

&amp;#x200B;

\# e) The sample generated by GPT2 is going to take a while so: take a nap or do a quick work out

&amp;#x200B;

\# (Warning: pressing any keys on your keyboard might interrupt the process and you will have to re-enter your prompt and start waiting again)

&amp;#x200B;

\# f) This is the sample text generated by the '345M' GPT2 model using the prompt above:

&amp;#x200B;

\# ""Scottish Parliament sits in Edinburgh and oversees EU affairs.# But the UK Government in Edinburgh, where Scots have their heads held high and the Scottish Government is almost entirely in London (the Scottish Parliament's new leader has been sacked from Edinburgh City Council just over a week ago), can not force the Scottish Government to go further and join its ""big boys"" in Brussels – such as the EU and China – who, by contrast, are far more constrained by Westminster.# Despite the fact that Scotland has voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, and despite it enjoying much the same tax rates as other EU countries – including those in England and Wales, and also France and Italy – the UK Government is determined to restrict other countries' access to Scottish markets and access to a trade deal.# What are the options?# The Scottish Government says that this means they have no choice but to seek agreement with the EU on many of its matters, such as migration, environmental policy, trade and investment – the same areas where Brussels would be unlikely to compromise on Scotland's sovereignty and the protection of our land and water.# This is because the British Government in Edinburgh, both Labour and Tory, would prefer an accord with the EU rather than to be forced to negotiate on these matters with Scotland.# However, the Scottish Government must also accept the current EU agreement on free movement of people – which would mean that Scottish citizens could be forced to work EU citizens from their country of birth, for example, rather than leaving them free to move into the UK from as many as 60 countries, most of them EU countries. Scotland would also need to accept that any future British-only trade deals would take into account EU customs and the rules on free movement of people.# This can only be a good situation for Scotland if Scotland, which enjoys a relatively low average immigration to the UK from Scotland – about 2,500 a year, compared with EU figures of about 20,000 – is excluded from the current free movement agreement. Even in the rare circumstances where Scottish citizens were able to immigrate from other EU countries, they are still not free to do so – as this is not available to citizens living in the UK.# Some have raised how this leaves Scotland without a viable negotiating position for the future. However, this is unlikely to change without a major change in the UK Government's negotiating approach.# How are we going to prevent it happening?# The Scottish Government have been clear for some time that there is no need to leave the EU – in fact Scotland will retain the free movement of people agreement because it has been the UK Government's position for many years that it would be preferable.# However, the current Brexit agreement cannot legally be altered unilaterally in the British Parliament or House of Commons even without the UK Government first agreeing changes in the way its legislation deals with Scotland.# The UK Government is also not willing to have an extra vote in the House of Commons (for example in the recent reshuffle by the Speaker) to change the free movement of people agreement between the UK and the EU.# The SNP and the Scottish Government are not willing to allow this to happen. Scottish people strongly support staying in the EU and want to ensure that any trade deal that comes out of the UK and the EU would give equal value to UK and EU citizens within the same framework.# The EU is prepared to negotiate these free movement issues. They have agreed they will continue to have a trade deal, which is currently being developed, with Scotland. An agreement on trade and investment with Scotland, which could be in the range of the FTA between the UK and some of the EU's most important industries, would give Scots jobs in Scotland that they haven't had for some time.# But there's been a lack of agreement on how to get around Parliament's ability to change the EU agreement.# The Scottish Government, which has made clear that all EU citizens must register their Scottish domicile when travelling in the UK to apply for visas or for British or Irish citizens to work in Ireland or the UK.# But this has to be negotiated separately with Parliament and the British Government in the British parliament in the future. This would require a major compromise of Parliament's power.# What is a major compromise?# Scotland has said that in the UK, it would be impossible for any legislation that affects immigration policy (such as changes to the immigration rules) to be passed by Parliament without it first first securing the backing of the European Commission (which is in charge). Therefore, all other EU government ministers and the British government would need to become ""partners"" in any legislation.# The EU also has a ""strategic partnership"" with the UK which includes issues relating to migration that the government doesn't want to touch.""

&amp;#x200B;

\# g) The result I received above is based on no training or settings for the GPT2 model. Just gave it a prompt and let it run for 20-30 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

\# The very bottom link I referred to has more information on working with the GPT2 model via the Client wrapper like: how many pieces of text to create.

&amp;#x200B;

\# 14) Final Notes: a) To close out of the 'testpip' virtualenv use:

&amp;#x200B;

deactivate

&amp;#x200B;

\# b) To delete 'testpip' virtualenv and everything in it use:

&amp;#x200B;

rm -rf testpip/

&amp;#x200B;

\# ==============================================================================

&amp;#x200B;

\# This is an alternate step 10 if you want a newer version of Tensorflow. I couldn't get it work with gpt2client and they say it doesn't as well.

&amp;#x200B;

\# This would be good for if you wanted to do stuff other than GPT2 work.

&amp;#x200B;

\# 10) These steps are specific to Tensorflow 2.0.0; go to this site:

&amp;#x200B;

\# a) Go to this website: [https://github.com/lhelontra/tensorflow-on-arm/releases](https://github.com/lhelontra/tensorflow-on-arm/releases)

&amp;#x200B;

\# b) Scroll down to the ""Tensorflow - 2.0"" heading and find the ""Asset"" called: ""tensorflow-2.0.0-cp37-none-linux\_armv7l.whl""

&amp;#x200B;

\# c) It should appear as a link or download file but just copy the link address

&amp;#x200B;

\# d) Then back in the terminal window where we left off, type:

&amp;#x200B;

wget (paste the copied link address here)

&amp;#x200B;

\# e) Uninstall previous versions of Tensorflow (if you have any):

&amp;#x200B;

python3 -m pip uninstall tensorflow

&amp;#x200B;

\# f) Finally install Tensorflow 2.0 from the file link we copied earlier:

&amp;#x200B;

python3 -m pip install tensorflow-2.0.0-cp37-none-linux\_armv7l.whl

&amp;#x200B;

\# ==============================================================================

&amp;#x200B;

\# Inspiration for this came from this post on reddit:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry\_pi/comments/ktx3pc/anyone\_interested\_in\_an\_image\_for\_the\_pi\_4\_8\_gig/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ktx3pc/anyone_interested_in_an_image_for_the_pi_4_8_gig/)

&amp;#x200B;

raspberry_pi,Can preinstalled NOOBs cards be reformatted via Windows?,"Main reason I ask is when I originally set up my Pi headless I had a lot of trouble with setting up the MicroSD. My windows PC was useless and I ended up formating and installing Raspbian on my android with a downloaded app 

It was all working fine until I spotted an issue with VNC that I couldn't really fix.

Since there isn't much on the card, I thought it would be nice to reformat and start over. I've seen tutorials of people setting up NOOBS via Windows but I can't for the life of me get windows to format the card

Since I'm a heavy Windows user it would be nice to set up the MicroSD to play nice with both Windows and Linux

I can supposedly format the card on my android phone but not on windows (every time it complains about write protection). I've tried changing the switch on the SD card adapter multiple times and even try clearing read only attributes in command line disk part but it still fails 


Are these cards specifically dedicated only for Linux machines or something?

Even when I format on my android and then plug into Windows it is still write protected"

My idea is to call raspistill() and the just gpio high to trigger a transistor that shorts the synch cable to ground.

I am able to listen via wired headphones but I cannot adjust the volume. It's working as a line-out. For example, if I'm watching a youtube video, the OS volume slider does nothing but the YouTube volume slider does work.


I'm gonna try to figure this out and post solutions as i go, any help welcome."

raspberry_pi,Excessive usage of bandwidth on my Raspberry Pi 3.,"Greetings
I use my pi as a 24/7 plex server. Recently, I've noticed an excessive usage of bandwidth from my Raspberry Pi 3. This usage happens at early morning, at 2-3 AM. Using iftop, I found out that my pi was downloading from the subdomains of a 1e100.net which is apparently owned by Google. 

Suspecting of being hit by a botnet, I formatted my entire SD card and started everything from scratch. This worked fine for some days, until yesterday where the bandwidth usage was quite high. What could be causing this? I'm at a loss to what to do.

The only thing I've found related to this is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/6tdyeb/1e100net_consuming_a_large_amount_of_data/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;ampcid=1*11gmwmu*cid*YW1wLUpWZzlSbUItUkJUTi03N3cxMTNzQ0E) which is related to chrome."

raspberry_pi,NAS with Raspberry Pi 4: slow transfer with 2GB and up files,"I bought a 5TB external HDD in the optic of turning a Raspberry Pi 4 into a home NAS.

I formatted the drive in ext4, hooked it up to the Pi with USB 3, hooked up the Pi to my router, set up a Samba server, and everything works fine for small files. My desktop PC is also hooked to my router.

However, for files that are 2GB and bigger, the transfer speed starts out fine (about 75MB/s from what I've seen?) but starts slowing down before reaching the 2GB mark, and it progressively gets excruciatingly slow. I've also the noticed with 650MB or so files that the transfer seems to freeze for a bit right before it's done. During that time, smdb's CPU usage seems to go up a bit. (35% or so, although the transfer is quite fast otherwise so maybe that's what it usually sits at during transfers.)

I've tried using NFS instead and I ran into the same issue pretty much. I've also tried using FTP, which worked fine except that the upload speed was stable but pretty slow (about 10MB/sec.)

I've also heard of somewhat famous ""usb-stick stall problem"", but apparently it has been fixed.

raspberry_pi,HDMI to CSI-2 Interface that supports RAW video,I am planning on building a external recorder/monitor for my DSLR camera. The idea is to connect the HDMI output of the camera (4k60p 10-bit 4:2:2) to the CSI-2 interface of the Raspberry Pi and just transfer the raw bytes to an SSD that is connected to the Pi by USB. I can't seem to find any CSI-2 interface that fits my requirement. Do I need to look into interfaces other than CSI-2?

I made a test Repository on the Hard Drive, and then tried to access it over ssh on my windows machine.  it works with the pi user, but not with any other user, which is my goal.  
I checked the ownership and read write access of the folders on the HDD, the owner is pi and RWX is Anyone.

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kqm16r/2021_jan_4_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Black screen when trying to boot from SSD on a Raspberry Pi 4B,"When I try to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B from my SSD, the screen goes black and the system does not start.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my current hardware setup:

1. Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB RAM.
2. Crucial MX500 1TB SSD Hard Drive CT1000MX500SSD1(Z).
3. SALCAR Hard Drive Enclosure for 2.5 SATA HDD and SSD with USB 3.0 Cable.
4. VEMONT USB Hub 3.0 4 ports with 5V/2A adapter.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the steps I followed:

1. Used the \*Raspberry Pi Imager\* to burn the default Raspbian OS 32 bit in my MicroSD.
2. Opened the terminal and executed the following commands:

&amp;#x200B;

sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo rpi-update

sudo reboot

&amp;#x200B;

3. Changed the EEPROM to \*stable\*:

&amp;#x200B;

sudo nano /etc/default/rpi-eeprom-update

sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -a

sudo reboot

&amp;#x200B;

4. Pluged in the SSD (it gets recognised as expected), and I cloned the current content of the MicroSD using the \*SD Card Copier\* utility.

5. I executed \`sudo raspi-config\` &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Boot Order &gt; USB Boot.

6. Checked the values of \`vcgencmd bootloader\_version\` and \`vcgencmd bootloader\_config\`, and it shows \`BOOT\_ORDER=0xf41\`.

7. Safely powered off the Raspberry, removed the MicroSD, leaving the SSD hard drive plugged in.

8. It seems to boot OK at first, it says something like ""Resizing partition..."" (the MicroSD did the same thing in its first boot), but afterwards, I see a black screen with no info whatsoever (even no cursor blinking) and the HDMI still preserves the signal.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I miss any step? I've followed \[this tutorial\]\[1\] and he managed to do it in real-time. Maybe some of my hardware is not compatible?

But when I put the microSD in its dedicated SD adapter and plugged it into my windows laptop it behaved quite weird. Multiple drives opened, and all of them were write protected despite the SD switch being off.

This wasn't like the many youtube videos I saw showing how to set up SSH

I couldn't think of any other way to add the files. I presumed the adapter was bad. I found out I could reinstall NOOBs and add the text files via app on my android so I stuck it in my phone and set it up. 

Now everything finally works fine, and Pi works etc

Later on I managed to find a different SD card adapter. I tried putting the microSD back in and plugged back into my windows laptop, again multiple drives opened and all write protected"

raspberry_pi,RasPi 4gb or 8gb for my needs,"Hello everyone

I've been looking forward to buying a Raspberry pi 4, just to experiment with it. I don't have alot of experience with tech but I've wanted to give this a try anyways, might as well start somewhere. I've wondered about if I really need the 8gb version or if the 4gb version might be enough for my needs. (yes the price matters to me)   
I've looked into projects to do with it and the first thing I found was pihole. I don't think I really need 8gb for it, I think even the 2gb version would be perfectly fine for that.   
But I've also thought about hosting a minecraft server on it. I've already done my research and seen alot of posts whether or not it would work, how to make it work, how to optimize it etc; but one thing that I haven't been able to read out of those posts was if the 8gb version is really needed?   
So far I've read that the cpu is gonna be the first thing to cap out on a server, not the ram. Btw I wouldn't want to do anything while running the server, just host it. So it wouldn't really make a difference if I got the 4gb version, right? 

Any input from you guys would be greatly appreciated"

raspberry_pi,"Cannot SSH into raspi (raspi connected to ethernet, laptop connected via wifi)","Hello,

I am currently trying to SSH into my raspi 3B+ through the windows command prompt, but get the error:

`ssh: connect to host 192.158.1.21 port 22: Connection timed out`

Here are the steps I took before reaching this point:

First I flashed Raspberry Pi OS onto my micro SD, installed it in the raspi, connected keyboard mouse and monitor and booted it up. Then, I enabled SSH through the config menu and powered it down. Then, I plugged it into the router that my PC is connected to through wifi (Asrock G10) and powered it on. Next, I ran Angry IP scanner to determine the current IP address of the raspi and finally tried connecting to it via SSH.

Probably worth noting, there is a blue indicator next to the raspi's IP address in angry IP scanner, according to the software this means that it is responding to pings, but there is no open port its connected to.

Also, the router that myself and the pi is connected to is not my main network router, it is plugged into the main router we use which is supplied by xfinity. So I guess its dependent upon the main router even though it has its own wifi network that is much much faster.

The reason I am trying to do this is so I can configure pi-hole to work on this faster secondary router, since it is the router that I am always connected to. I got it working on the main xfinity router, but pi-hole would only work properly if I was connected to that slow network.

Maybe this set up wont even work since this router is not independent, but i'm still a noob so I figured I should get some assistance here before giving it up. Thanks!"

My google-foo is not helping me in this fight and I'm getting with no more possible search queries to run.. so I thought I could ask here \^\^'

I've had a weird issue on my PI when I was playing around with KODI. After a restart, the resolution went from 1080 to 720. I've tried a lot of possible solutions but nothign worked, until I've noticed that in the ""Secreen configuration"" I have 2 display represented: HDMI 1 and HDMI1. They overlap and one of them had the 720 resolutiion, the other was 1080. Once I've put both to 1080 my sceen (apparently) went back to normal. 

I said apparently because it's not normal.. I do not have 2 screens and seems like the system is recognising 2 virtual outputs and mixing them on the same phisical HDMI. If I drag the 2 display represented in the ""Screen configuration"" and put them one next to the other, then I see some menus, but I don't see others.. like I was missing some layers of my desktop.

Any hint on how to change this mess? What did I touch? \^\^'

I've never used python, or done anything much beyond hello world in any other language.

I'm considering a project where I'd press an external button and have a pre-recorded message played back instantly, in clear, high quality. There would be several buttons, each with their own sound clip. These buttons need to be large, and completely separate to each other, so not like a keyboard, more like a doorbell kind of setup. 

There are pre-built 'buttons' on amazon that do this, completely self contained, but the sound quality is terrible, and very quiet. 

From my very limited knowledge, I think I'd need a pi with GPIO pins, and either a pre-built app, or learn enough python to program it myself. I'd attach the buttons to the GPIO pins, and assign a sound clip to each one. When the button is pressed, it instantly plays the sound clip through an attached speaker. 

Is this realistic for a *complete* novice like myself?

Is there anything else that I'm missing here?

I assume any pi with GPIO pins could handle something like this?"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry pi has messed up my port forwarding rule,"So a bit of a back story as I don’t know why this is happening, and I don’t know what’s relevant..

Me and my friends have a minecraft server which I run from my PC. It is not run on a pi. It’s nothing special it’s just a small server. 

As well as this, I recently got a 3D printer. I decided it would be wise to purchase a pi to make my printer connect wirelessly to my PC - and it works great. However, when I tried running my minecraft server later, it wouldn’t let my friends join.

I originally thought my IP had changed (they need it to connect) as it isn’t static, however it hadnt. I checked port forwarding on my router settings to see if the rule I made had been deleted (it had been before), but it hadn’t. This though, is where I found the problem.

The device on my port forwarding rule SHOULD be set to my PC, and use my PCs IP address. However, now I noticed that in its place was “raspberrypi” - still using my computers IP address. I assume this is the root of the problem, although I do not know why it is happening.

I checked the IP of my pi and it is of course different to my computers IP. It is also NOT the IP that showed up on the port forwarding rule.

TL;DR: my recently purchased raspberry pi has replaced my computer in my port forwarding rule, and now my minecraft server won’t run"

I have always wanted a nice tiny fireplace to put on my desk. I recently picked up a tiny fireplace that I found by accident and while it is okay, I thought that it could be much better with a screen and a fireplace video. 

Here is what I have currently:
[Mini Yule Log Fireplace](https://imgur.com/a/UjQAi6I)

The opening measures just about 2.5 inches. So I was thinking a 2.8 inch screen would be the perfect size. The inside looks big enough to fit a Pi Zero.

Here is what I am thinking. Get a Raspberry Pi Zero W and connect it with that screen. Place a video file on an microSD card and have it play on start up. I would also like to use that speaker or one of a similar size for sound (fire crackling). Would that be possible with that setup? I found a Raspberry Pi Zero screen that is 2.8 inch 60 fps and is 640x480 that I think would look perfect for realistic fire movement. It has a built in touchscreen. The only thing I have had trouble trying to find info on is how to get sound output and tie in a small speaker.

So realizing my mistake I set up another sd card exactly the way I did the first one.  Now the pi isn't connecting to the internet.  I tried setting it up with bonjour and doing it over usb but that doesn't work either.  The pi definitely partially boots because my computer now detects it over usb but doesn't know what to do with it.  I also put the sd set up for config over WiFi in my pi 4 and it worked no problem.

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/km6lk1/2020_dec_28_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank or saying no signal, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,A bigger push button doesn't work properly or slow.,"Hi, I have a problem with a big push button. When I press it, it seems like it has a small delay between each press or sometimes doesn't work at all. I have to press it for a short moment then release it to make it work as intended. Compare to a smaller button which response well and doesn't have a problem at all.

The physical connection is on a second photo (connect GPIO to Ground). I'm not sure how to fix this issue. Any I can fix this?

raspberry_pi,Need help with smart gardening in moderation with my Pi 4,"After a year of Covid-enhanced indoor DIY projects the plan is to move outdoors in '21 during the continued lockdown in my area.  We will be installing a couple of raised bed garden boxes and I'm intrigued by all the projects relating to soil measurements, automatic watering, etc.

**Project Goal:** *use a Pi 4 I had lying around from a previous project to collect planter box soil measurements (moisture, pH, temp) in real-time data viewable on my phone.*  

I already have a Racchio irrigation controller that will handle the watering, so that obstacle has been avoided.  I just really want to see what is going on in the soil throughout the year and tackle it with very little tweaking on the mechanical side.

Ideally, I hook up my Pi in the shed (already reachable by Wi-Fi) and run probes to my (5) garden boxes.  

**Challenges:** 

\- buying the right soil probes that can sit in the soil from March - October and not corrode or poison the soil.

\- cable management along un-covered garden area, from boxes to stone path to shed (all in same fenced in area but cable runs could total 50')

\- Figuring out what types of hats or controllers I need to function between the Pi and the (5+) probes I'll need to run (1 for each box).

\- On the software side: I've built some simple Pi projects in the past.  But this looks to stretch my limited programming skills.  Hoping I can grab most of this off of Git repos.

**Suggestions? Links to similar projects?  Feedback from what you've done in the past?  Anything is appreciated.**"

raspberry_pi,Mazda 6 (2004) Stock Navi mod: NaviPi!,"Hello! 

I'm pleased to be able to finally present my completed project. I installed RPi 4B running OpenAuto Pro inside the stock Navigation unit of the first generation Mazda 6 (2004). I had to track down the unit and ship it to me because my car didn't come with it, and painted it. 

I also used an AUX XcarLink module for Bluetooth audio + music so that the stock stereo can remain fully functional (including the small display). I also took extra care so no permanent modifications are made to the car; I made a custom Mazda to Mazda harness so you can remove everything. 

Features:

* Functional OAP (no backup camera because I use an aftermarket Mirror camera)
* Functional OBD
* Functional wireless AA
* Functional Google Assistant
* Functional steering wheel controls (including answering/hanging up calls)
* Functional stock stereo unit
* GPS module
* RTC module
* Automatic screen dimming (photoresistor inside stock IR sensor window)
* Temperature (including greek summers: 40-65C)
* Functional stock Navi behavior (all buttons work, screen tilts and opens/closes, position ""memory"" works)
* Safe power up and shutdown (RPi powers up on ""ACC on"" and triggers a shutdown on ""ACC off"", BAT power stays on for 15 seconds waiting for RPi to turn off safely then turns off).

raspberry_pi,Is the Raspberry Pi 3B+ model defective?,"Around two years ago, I bought a Raspberry Pi 3B+. It didn't have any issues at first. I did connect it to an official Raspberry Pi Touchscreen at some point. However, one day it just suddenly stopped working while I was experimenting with the Windows 10 on Raspberry Pi project. For the first few boots, it worked just fine. At some point however, it just stopped working after I powered it off and back on. I don't think an operating system can brick the device so I think the problem is something else. I'm pretty sure I didn't short any components or pins and I'm also sure the problem is not related to static. Using different SD cards didn't fix the problem. The power LED (red) would always stay on and the ACT LED (green) wouldn't do anything.

It seems like I'm not the only person who had a Raspberry Pi 3B+ randomly die. Googling for these symptoms will show you multiple posts on different sites ([this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/8edskt), [Raspberry Pi forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=220265) and [StackExchange](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/85547/pi-stopped-working-suddenly) are some of them). Some of these sites even state that the 3B+ is defective. However, I couldn't find any official statement about this.

My question is, is this all just a huge coincidence? Or is there an actual defect with the 3B+ model?

By the way, after I failed to boot up that 3B+ multiple times, I decided to look at the pins to check if they were giving the correct values. However, I accidentally shorted 5V to some other pin while doing that so it's now definitely dead."

Once I do this and I try to connect I saw that the screen is not visible because the raspberry pi is stuck at a terminal screen. So to bypass that I ran raspi-config and enabled desktop auto login. This required me to run  sudo apt-get install lightdm. Which installed lightdm. Now when I connect through VNC I can see the debian 10 login but the default password of pi and raspberry cause it to return to the log in screen. Anything else I type actually returns an error saying wrong password. So I know pi and raspberry work, but why does it bring me back to the log in screen?

The Raspberry Pi Foundation also conducts very strict moderation of messages on the forum and in the comments. My questions about the timing of the appearance of drivers for a video card or the final version of a 64-bit OS have never been published.

raspberry_pi,Disappointed in Pi4 performance? Is it me or my expectations?,"So I bought a Pi4 with the expectation that I could replace my original Xiamoi Mi Box (whatever the original original one is. It’s like 4 year+ old at this point). 

I wasn’t expecting it to blow the box out of the water. But I thought I might get better reliability when it came to Bluetooth/WiFi and flexibility with more storage space and what I could install on it. 

However, i am extremely disappointed. I’ve tried a couple different set ups but right now I have retropie installed with Kodi going off of that. While my Bluetooth devices have been working far better than on the Mi Box games have been performing worse and video on Kodi is choppier than the Mi Box playing the same stream. 

Am I missing something? Like I said I wasn’t expecting the Pi to blow it out of the water but I was expecting much more performance than what I am getting. I have a heat sink and fan as well not that I believe what I have been doing is pushing the system. At this point I’m thinking of upgrading to whatever the current Mi Box is or getting a chrome cast with Google TV and a usb c hub."

Whenever I type in a command I usually get an error and then when I type in the command again it usually works.  


An example of this is,

This is my first time messing around with cellular modems so I am just curious what's happening, if it's normal or if it's a bug and shouldn't be happening.

raspberry_pi,Do you guys want a program for uploading code to the Raspberry Pi remotely or even just raw commands and many other features or something else?,Hi. I am working on a tool that looks for Raspberry Pi's that are connected to a network and allows you to upload code from your computer and run it all automatically with error reporting and logging. This allows you to edit on your main device and will be much faster and more efficient than the existing methods like using git and other alternatives. It will also be much more flexible as your can also send custom commands and not just files and will allow for high levels of customization. The whole thing will be open sourced as soon as I have a stable version. However as I continue with the project I repeatedly find myself asking if anyone even wants a tool like this? I don't want to spend days on something nobody want's and would far rather create something that people would actually use. So please tell me if you would want something like this and if not what you would want to see instead.

Recently bought my very first Raspberry Pi (4B 8GB) and quite excited waiting for it to arrive!

Most likely I'm overly too niave/ambitious but i was planning to try and build maybe about 10 or so projects like below

1) a script to use a (pre built no breadboard needed) power button to safely turn on/off the Pi and run all scripts from boot
2) a script to turn on a fan for the Pi if temp gets too high (i think there's an inbuilt temp sensor)
3) a project I saw about creating an ad blocker
4) Create private file server / NAS
5) it would be cool to use ML and social media API to learn about how company bots work 

In distant future maybe also try things like 

6) get a camera  add on and set up a motion recognition / facial recognition app maybe like a security camera
7) perhaps extend point 6) to check if I'm sleeping and hence turn off my computer 😅
8) I saw ads about 'finger bots' that help push a button and hence turn devices into smart devices. Perhaps if I can connect this to my Pi then I could do things like turn off the lights at night"

raspberry_pi,Need some help with using a 52pi Sensorhub with an old Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 2,"Hey guys, I started playing around with an old [Raspberry Pi (Model B Revision 2) with 26 pins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#/media/File:Drawing_of_Raspberry_Pi_model_B_rev2.svg) I have been given. First project is going to be a little weather station so I bought the [52pi Sensorhub](https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php/DockerPi_Sensor_Hub_Development_Board_SKU:_EP-0106), not realizing that it is meant to be mounted directly onto the RPi with 40 pins - which obviously won't work with my 26 pin version.

Anyhow, I went ahead and compared the different pin settings between my 26 and the 40 pin version using these sheets:

* [Model B Revision 2](https://pi4j.com/1.2/pins/model-b-rev2.html)
* [Model 3 B+](https://pi4j.com/1.2/pins/model-3b-plus-rev1.html)

From my understanding, the only pins that are actually needed by the Sensorhub are the +3.3V and the two I2C pins (blue pins in the diagrams), so I went ahead and connected them (1 - 1, 3 - 3, 5 - 5) and also enabled I2C with `raspi-config` command.

However, when I start my raspberry (the sensor lights up) and execute `sudo i2cdetect -y 1`, nothing gets detected and the output just looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ i2cdetect -y 1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f

I've double checked the connections and they seem fine so I figured I must be doing something else wrong.

There isn't much information available on how to use the 52pi and the old RPi version I have so I was hoping you guys have an idea what I'm doing wrong! Thanks for your help!"

First project is going to be a little weather station so I bought the [52pi Sensorhub](https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php/DockerPi_Sensor_Hub_Development_Board_SKU:_EP-0106), not realizing that it is meant to be mounted directly onto the RPi with 40 pins - which obviously won't work with my 26 pin version.

Anyhow, I went ahead and compared the different pin settings between my 26 and the 40 pin version using these sheets:

* [Model B Revision 2](https://pi4j.com/1.2/pins/model-b-rev2.html)
* [Model 3 B+](https://pi4j.com/1.2/pins/model-3b-plus-rev1.html)

From my understanding, the only pins that are actually needed by the Sensorhub are the +3.3V and the two I2C pins (blue pins in the diagrams), so I went ahead and connected them (1 - 1, 3 - 3, 5 - 5) and also enabled I2C with `raspi-config` command.

However, when I start my raspberry (the sensor lights up) and execute `sudo i2cdetect -y 1`, nothing gets detected and the output just looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ i2cdetect -y 1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
    00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

I also tried the [sample program from the 52pi wiki](https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php/DockerPi_Sensor_Hub_Development_Board_SKU:_EP-0106#Program_in_Language_Java.28Raspberry_Pi.29) without success (I/O Error).

I've double checked the connections and they seem fine so I figured I must be doing something else wrong.

There isn't much information available on how to use the 52pi and the old RPi version I have so I was hoping you guys have an idea what I'm doing wrong! Thanks for your help!"

raspberry_pi,RPi 4 Model B - ESXi install problem - can't access UEFI settings,"I tried following a couple videos on installing ESXi ARM on my new RPi4 8GB ([NovaSpirit](https://youtu.be/f1e9SNnbU2c) &amp; [NetworkChuck](https://youtu.be/6aLyZisehCU)), but I could never access the settings menu on the initial UEFI boot to increase the RAM limit. I spent too long troubleshooting and got annoyed because the process seems so easy. So now I'm checking to see if Reddit can help.

Two things were curious about the process:

1. Upon powering the Pi, there was a black screen with a small green dash/underscore, and it took a surprisingly long time (&gt;5min) for the white RPi logo screen to show up.

2. Spamming the ESC key never worked - almost like the pi was preoccupied with another process or just not getting my input. I was also not able to 'Press any key to enter the Boot Manager Menu' as shown in the ss.

I was using a bluetooth Logitech , so I also tried a hardwired keyboard with no success. 

I made sure the EEPROM was on the latest version, first by updating it via CLI, then later by using the tool from the RPi Imager. I formatted my SD card for FAT32 then followed instructions for copying the boot files over (both the UEFI firmware and the RPi firmware master, including the config adjustment for gpu\_mem=16). 

In troubleshooting, I tried using different UEFI firmwares (v1.19, v1.20, v1.21), but mostly same behavior - although when I used the latest v1.21, I noticed that white RPi logo screen populated much faster... but still no input response. 

Being that it seemed to be continuously attempting a net boot (for info's sake, I tried with and without an ethernet cable attached), I decided to boot into PiOS and set the boot order to USB - mostly just to confirm that it wasn't somehow defaulting straight to net boot. I repeated the same 'boot files' process from above except using a new flash drive instead of an SD card, but I got the same result. 

My hunch is that I'm somehow botching the boot media, but I really don't understand how. I followed both videos' instructions as well as consulted the instructional PDF found on VMWare's website.

I eventually gave up and just installed a distro, but I'm hoping to try again if I anyone has insight on why this was happening. Thanks ahead of time.

raspberry_pi,Net worth tracker idea,"I had an idea for a raspberry pi build. It’s a little douchey but an automatic net worth tracker. it’d monitor mutual fund values, Zillow, debts on credit karma (probably updating once or twice a day) and display to a simple 8 digit number display. 

I didn’t see anything already ready made out there. But I’d like to attempt it myself. There are lots of stock ticker/crypto stuff that probably could help me along.

This would be my first build that isn’t just someone else’s project slightly modified, but in my imagination it should be on the easier side. Just pulling the right numbers from the right places and doing some arithmetic.

I guess my question is: am I right to think this is a simpler project? These are obviously more secure websites so there could be some issues there. Thoughts?"

raspberry_pi,Can I boot up into the GUI then run a script that opens a browser?,"Backstory - my friends parents are really old school country people that don’t know how to even read but they love being able to zoom with their family. For obvious reasons, we can’t keep going over to their house to set up their iPad each and every time that they accidentally delete zoom app. So my friend came up with the idea of a raspberry pi. 

The main show - the idea is to have them plug the raspberry pi in, it will load into the GUI then a script will run to control a browser that goes to zoom online and even types everything out. When they’re done, they just unplug and then wait until the next time so it would have to be repeatable each time. I’m quite familiar with python and know that could be used with selenium. So could I write a script to run selenium to do it’s thing each time that gets loaded on boot after the GUI is running?"

I've been playing with LED strips using the FastLED library on Arduino and it has been quite fun. However, I prefer programming in Python to the Arduino IDE. Previously, I had used the StandardFirmata library along with python modules like Pyfirmata to directly control my Arduino Uno with Python. I can use Pyfirmata to control simple things like turning a single LED on and off.  


However, working with LED strips is complicated with Python. Is there an equivalent library in Python that can help me perform tasks similar to the FastLED library in Arduino IDE or NeoPixel?"

raspberry_pi,How to create your file without an extension to ssh into a Pi on Mac using TextEdit.,"I had a ton of issues with this for the past few days, the instructions on the pi site were a little confusing for Mac and I didn’t know I had to change the file type and delete the text without a fair bit of head scratching, hope this helps you!

1. Load Raspberry Pi OS onto your SD, using whatever OS writing tool you like, Raspberry Pi imager is what I used.

2. Pull out your SD from your Mac and then put it back in.

3. Open the SD named “boot” in finder, then use spotlight search to open TextEdit

4. Click the “New Document” button on the bottom left of the screen

5. Name this document ssh by clicking “untitled” twice or clicking the drop down menu directly to the left, make sure it’s saved to “boot”. Then exit out of the document with the red X, you should see it pop up in the boot folder.

6. Double click the name of the file that just appeared in boot and should be named “ssh” rename it from “ssh.rtf” to “ssh.txt” you will get a prompt asking you if you’re sure, hit ok.

7. You should now be able to open this file with TextEdit again by clicking on it, do so now and delete all the text inside before navigating out and ejecting the SD.

8. You should now be able to find you pi’s ip with a scanner or your routers admin and can run “ssh pi@[Pi ip]” in terminal."

raspberry_pi,Live video streaming on Raspberry Pi 4 (vs Raspberry Pi 3),"I own a Raspi 3B from 2017, and was **wondering how much better the video call experience is on the new Raspi 4**, and **what amount of memory is ideal**.

This is probably not the ideal setup, but using Google Meet on my Raspi 3B w/ a logitech webcam didn't go so well. It was a pixellated slideshow, and the CPU was being throttled due to overheating.

(I'm assuming a large part of that was browser based video encoding being incredibly inefficient)

Any help would be appreciated!"

raspberry_pi,Pi for a shop computer?,"I have a big detached garage where I tinker with cars and do some metal fab work. I often find myself trekking into the house to use my desktop to look something up (like torque specs) or to order something. 

I think a very lightweight computer would serve the role nicely. I am leaning towards a Pi 4 or 400, I am familiar with the platform and have a nas/pihole/pivpv/plex server in my basement running on a Pi4. 
I haven't installed a desktop operating system on a pi yet, so I am not sure what to expect as far as a browsing experience. I need to be able to watch youtube videos but I don't need them to be 4k or anything. I have a old monitor that I plan to use, but I am not sure what keyboard/mouse would work to stand up to the dirt/grease/metal dust in the shop. This is one reason that I am doubting the PI 400, I think the dust in the keyboard might kill it.

I use inlfuxdb to store the data and telegraf to acquire the data. Senor data is polled from a python script every minute and is published via MQTT, telegraf is subscribed to the MQTT topic. I decided to use MQTT instead of other methods so that I can incorporate remote sensors, probably ESP based, in the future.

I currently have a 3B+, and that appears to also be on the way out also two years after purchase. I replaced the SD card to a Class 10 when I bought it, and initially this seemed to be fine, but even now, running scripts is not as fast as it used to be.

raspberry_pi,Hacking with Raspberry Pi Setup - Wireless Adapter,"Hey guys,

My issue is that I can't get my USB wireless adapter to work in raspberry pi. 

I've previously created the environment in virtual box to make my USB wireless adapter work - and like many it would allow the machine to then recognise it as wlan0 when put it in and do iwconfig - but I recognise that that was due to some configurations before starting my Kali Linux desktop. 

Now on raspberry pi I see theres already a wlan0, and when I put the adapter in, nothing new comes up, (and the light on the adapter isn't on) so this seems that wlan0 here is the usual Wifi card that comes with it.

I've tried putting adapter in and running: 

**iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor** 

But it still keeps saying 'operation not supported', which together with the lack of the usual light on the adapter means I'm pretty sure my adapters just not being recognised.

The adapter definitely works I've used it for months in Kali Linux through the Virtualbox, and earlier on today.

How do I get Raspberry Pi to recognise my USB Wireless adapter?

Thanks!

Phil"

raspberry_pi,Raspbian create shortcut to turn off ONLY the screen (without turning off the audio),"I use the Raspi 400 with its own monitor as a 2nd desktop for functions like music playback, note taking etc. Most of the time the screen should be off; it should (ideally) turn on when I make a movement of the mouse or press a keyboard button. 

I DON'T want the screen to turn off automatically after X minutes - that's why I am using Xscreensaver to set mode to ""Disable Screen Saver"". 

What I'd been doing so far is turning off / on the monitor using the power button on the monitor - this wears out the button + briefly breaks the flow of work so I'm thinking there must be a better solution to this.

I'm using a [MicroHDMI to VGA converter](https://www.factoryforward.com/product/microhdmi-vga-converter-raspberry-pi-4/) \- with a Frontech HDMI + VGA monitor, using VGA because monitor doesn't have a speaker and I don't have a USB speaker - with a speaker connected to the audio-out port on the microHDMI-to-VGA converter's body.   


I found the following two solutions: 

i) tvservice -o to turn off, tvservice -p to turn on  
ii) xset -display :0 dpms force\_off to turn of, press keyboard or move mouse to turn it back on

Both of the above work, with the additional unintended effect of turning off audio output (e.g. there's an audiobook or music playing in the background)

&amp;#x200B;

I found another solution:  


iii) xscreensaver-command -activate

which kinda works if Xscreensaver display mode is set to ""Blank Screen""  
but this still keeps the monitor's backlight on and so its still consuming unnecessary power; I essentially want to turn off the monitor / the signal to the monitor without turning off the audio.

Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A:. 99.999% of the time it's either a bad SD card or power problems. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,What's the deal with WiFi power saving and random dropouts? NetworkManager seems to enable it?,"So, I keep having incessant networking issues with NetworkManager based Pi boards.  After a week, or a month, or however long, they eventually take a crap and become unreachable.  


One person on a forum said they had problems on every SBC they ever used, if WiFi powersave was enabled.  A quick \`sudo dmesg | grep power\`  showed   
\`\[   34.668706\] brcmfmac: brcmf\_cfg80211\_set\_**power**\_mgmt: **power** save enabled\`, which changed to disabled after editing \`/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\` to disable it.  


There is nothing in the default file to explicitly enable it, but nonetheless it seems to be on by default when you install NetworkManager, even though they say raspbian disables it when NetworkManager \*isn't\* used.  


I can't know for about a week if that was the real problem, but it seems rather plausible.  What is this setting actually supposed to do, anyway?    


I thought WiFi power saving was a high-frequency thing that wakes up for a few milliseconds at a time,  and shouldn't have any noticable issue besides a little more latency, but people are saying it just completely goes to sleep after a bit, for no good reason.  Is it a bug in the WiFi drivers?  Or is this normal behavior and it's meant for use with some external wakeup source?"

raspberry_pi,Ubuntu newcomer...is it really slow?,"Hi guys! So far I've had several raspbian or raspios devices (bananapi, raspberry...all 1GB RAM), and have been happy with their overall performance. I recently went and purchased a more recent Raspberry Pi 4, with 4GB RAM. And I went ""great, now I can get 64bit with Ubuntu!"". So I installed the official Ubuntu 20.10 64 bit image that comes in the Raspberry Imager. This thing takes veeeery long to boot. I tried the server...and then install LXDE. It's been about 20 mins installing the desktop. I mean, it keeps going, I can see the progress. But it's just...slow. Is this the expected behavior/performance? Is there a huge optimization on raspberry pi os, or did I do something wrong? I'd basically want to have an up to date browser with decent performance/acceleration, not much of a fan of Firefox ESR version...

To me it seems like they both use the GPIO pins, and therefore the solution is to desolder the RTC connector and solder it via wires directly onto the PCB? Which then makes space for the display to be mounted onto the GPIO pins.

Is there another workaround which wouldn't require any soldering?

Cheers :)"

raspberry_pi,RPI strange problems - RPI OS 64bit - crashing all time - very slow SSD,"Hello !  :D

I am moving from my old two pi 3bs to one pi4 4GB but i have big (strange) problems in this procedure.

1. I  took my SSD and USB to SATA adapter (USB 3.0) and flashed it with  raspbian 64bit (from august) - It wont b oot in usb 3.0 ports (veeeeery  slow loading each boot files takes seconds until it reaches 1.30m/1,30m  and stopps some b oot things) I followed this tutorial:   [https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=245931](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=245931)   and after it, it b oots but i only have 25MB/s (worse than on pi3)
2. After i set up all my services from my old servers i restarted and it wont load further than rainbow screen.
3. Sometimes LXDE and all applications crash randomly and I get the following errors:

&amp;#x200B;

all ext4 file system errors

So  i checked my SSD for corruption - nothing found even on other machines.  After a complet reinstall of raspberry pi OS i installed again all my  services and just after installing motioneye (with some errors) -&gt; (i  did  apt --fix-broken ...) I cant b oot and only get rainbow screen...

At this moment I am really frustrated with Pi4 and RPI OS 64 bit...

I hope you can help me so I can turn my lights back on ;) (home automation also runs on it)

What would be a better choice here? A Pi with a Camera + IR module or an off the shelf WiFi / IP camera from Amazon?

Port 32400: Plex Media Server  
Port 8086: InfluxDB w/ Telegraf service  
Port 80: Pihole  
Port 3000: Grafana

Looking at Grafana it doesn't seem its too taxing but just wondering what else / how many services people usually have running on their pis until performance reduces drastically.

Thanks"

raspberry_pi,Pi 4b 4gb suddenly broken?,"I bought a pi 4B 4GB around a month ago and when I got it it worked perfectly. I used it a few days (shutting it down a few times too and yes with the ""right"" way) all worked fine. Then I went a week away from home.  
When I got back the problems started I plugged the official powersupply in and  then the red LCD just kept flashing non stop. So I thought shoot power problem, tried with some other USB-C cables nope still flashing, I tried reinstalling the software since I didn't do a lot on it maybe there was a problem in the software? Nope still red flashing light. I tried pulling everyting out of the pi (ethernet, micro sd and a fan case I got) still the same problem.  
Now I don't know what to do, most problems on the internet have other problems like a certain pattern to the flashing but mine just keeps on going. When I try connecting it to my pc somehow it stops some functions of the headset in the usb port next to it (leds go off from the headset) and the pi only blinks once and then there is no light at all (and the headset is also without power but doesn't disconnect tho)  
I really don't know what to do and I don't want to send it back and wait for a new one or till it is repaired."

raspberry_pi,Pi 400 as a low-power FM transmitter,"Hi,

I recently got a Raspberry Pi 400 and I tried this [https://github.com/markondej/fm\_transmitter](https://github.com/markondej/fm_transmitter) without an antenna. The range was approximately of about 5 feet, from what I could notice.

Now I've heard a lot about square wave harmonics and Raspberry Pis; **without** an antenna, could it be legally dangerous for me to try some things with it in my house, or is it low-power enough so that those harmonics are properly contained within a very small perimeter ? I live in Canada.

Thanks!"

I said share because the running windows can be maximized to 1024x768 at the top left of the screen where HDMI1 resides. 

I can only think of 2 reasons:

1. I swapped between HDMI ports before for the same monitor, doesn't make sense but this is my first pi ever so maybe they work different (?).
2. I installed RetroPie on top of the Raspberry Pi OS before but have now removed them. Other than this, my pi is pretty vanilla.

Upon installation OMV changed the IP address. thus locking me out of PiHole and HomeBridge. Not even sure how to access them now. I thought I had set up a static but apparently, I did not previously.

I did set up a static IP via dhcpcd.conf =, But when I run hostname -I. It shows two IPs as being active.

raspberry_pi,"My LAN cable connection doesn't work, when I have usb drive plugged","I bought new raspberry pi 4 with 8 GB ram, and it behaves strange-  while it has connected external usb drive, which has it's separate power  supply and I power up rpi, it doesn't connect to the local network,  even tho, light from RJ45 port lights up. When I an testing it with ping  from another computer it says ""host unreachable"", but when I wiggle  this cable a little, then suddenly ping responds and connection is  stable while rpi is powered on.

Such behavior doesn't appear when none of the disks is connected to  the usb port. It just boots up and ping responds after a minute. I want  to emphasize, that external HDD has its own power supply, so I guess it  is not caused by the power drop.

I tested it several times, and I wonder if I was unlucky and my rpi  is broken, or maybe it is something that happens for this version. I  wanted to ask you guys, because I'm not sure if I should give it back to  the shop and buy the same version or any another one."

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

So is there an adapter to hdmi or something?"

raspberry_pi,Are SD cards suitable for long-term production use with low write applications?,"I have seen many reports of SD card corruption. I'm trying to decide between SD card and USB SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

Some advice seems to state that corruption is inevitable long term, and other advice seems to state that SD cards are fine as long as you use a quality one, and shutdown without random poweroffs.

I am considering using a RBP in some production-type scenarios where corruption wouldn't be like, lose the business type catastrophe, but would be a pain to fix. My applications would be some writes, but not frequent writes, other than normal background linux processes.

I'm trying to decide if it's even worth trying to use an SD card, or if I should just go right to adding an SSD. The obvious downsides to directly adding an SSD are size and cost. Thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated."

raspberry_pi,Very frustrated...Is OnionPi a router or a proxy?,"I seem to recall building a Tor router about five or six years ago that functioned purely as a router.  You would connect to the WiFi hotspot and all your browsing traffic would be automatically anonymized without any browser/proxy configuration on the client.  


For the past few weeks I have been trying to recreate this process with zero luck.  Most all the tutorials I have found only allow for the Pi to be a Tor proxy, which means I need to configure proxy options on a Windows host, which I am trying to avoid.    


Am I crazy or is it in fact possible to setup an Onion Pi or something similar in this fashion?  The primary goal being to setup a separate WiFi network on my perimeter network/DMZ that also disguises/anonymizes my IP and browser traffic without it being readily apparent to anyone who uses the Windows machine that it is happening (unless they go to WhatsMyIP or IPChicken and notice it changes each refresh) or why. (no configuration to uncover on the native machine, just looks like a standard DHCP lease)  


Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.  I have Pi3s and Pi4s ready to use for this so just let me know which is preferred."

raspberry_pi,Pushing the PWM or DMA throughput Limits of a 2GB Pi4,"Due to a bit of phenomenal customer service, I’m finding myself with an extra 2GB Pi4 and I’m thinking of using it as a direct LED controller - not as a controller driving a collection of WLED/E1.31/DMX nodes. 

If I’m counting correctly, there’s 26 pins that can be used for software PWM. Is that correct? If so, that means I can drive 8 independent (3/LED strip) non-addressable strips. 

What the maximum throughput if I’m trying send a serial bit stream? That will determine the maximum number of LEDs I can drive with an addressable strip."
raspberry_pi,Raspbian install on Windows with Win32DiskImager?,"Hi All,

Not sure if I am posting in the correct subreddit, but please let me know if I need to move this post. TY!

Context: I just got a raspberry pi 400 and am looking to play around with raspbian desktop. I have had to set up raspberry pi 2's and 3's with Win32DiskImager.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue:

I typically use the 'Win32DiskImager' tool to image my raspberry pi SD cards, however with the newer images, it appears as though the image has different contents I am used to.

When going to the raspberry pi website, I find that they now have a windows application that will 'do this for you'. 

Is it no longer valid to use the 'Win32DiskImager' option? When looking further in to the .iso that is provided on the raspbian site, I find that there are more 'windows style' files like a .INI and a 'setup.exe' file.

When I attempt to image the SD card with the image provided on the raspbian site (using 'Win32DiskImager'), I find that only 2 folders are on the sd card and the pi fails to boot. I am separately troubleshooting the SD card to see if there are any faults in it, but I am fairly confident it isn't a hardware problem in the SD card itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I have attempted to find something about this on google, but I am not sure I am searching for the right thing...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Used to use Win32DiskImager to image SD cards in the past and now the writes don't look the same for the most recent ISO (2020-12-11-raspios-buster-i386.iso)"

raspberry_pi,Turing Pi as a low-cost power-sipping Minecraft server,"I read a tutorial about how to set up a Minecraft server on a Raspberry Pi. It works, but the processing power and RAM limitations can often be a huge constraint.

I found out about something called the Turing Pi, which allows multiple Compute Modules to act as a cluster and share their processing power and resources. They're working on one that will house four Compute Module 4 units on SO-DIMMs plugged into a main board.

They do have one that houses seven Compute Module 3 units, but they're all out of stock.

I figured I would go ahead and stock up on a few things for projects that I may want to do for the next few months. I haven't done too many Pi projects and most of them have been retro gaming related. I'm torn between buying a few Pi 3 B+ boards or just going for the Pi 4 boards. I have a few Zero Ws laying around so not concerned about small form factor Pis. I'm fairly new to this stuff so I probably won't be doing some next level projects but tinkering with electronics and coding helps my anxiety and depression. That being said, I want the best bang for my buck. If the difference for small projects isn't that noticeable then I'll go with the cheaper option but if it is actually worth the little bit extra then I'll go for the other. Any info or opinions would be great. Thanks!"
raspberry_pi,"Finally Completed my PiClock Build, Updated for Openweather and GeekPi Sensor Hub","Used a WIMAXIT 8in 1280x800 HDMI display

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+

GeeKPi Docker Sensor Hub

Code based on the original PiClock from here: [https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock](https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock)

This has not been updated for a couple of years and still uses the Darksky API which is no longer available. Never coded in Python before but it's quite simple to update for Openweather following the guide on the Openweather site: [https://openweathermap.org/darksky-openweather](https://openweathermap.org/darksky-openweather). All the changes are done in a single function wxfinished() and the openweather API call is changed in getwx(). The rest of the code can be left alone (if you use Mapbox or Google maps; I used mapbox).

You don't get the moon phases, but I replaced those with Internal Temperature and Humidity from the Sensor Hub instead.  Had to adjust the internal temp sensor value to stop it reading too high but really happy with it now it's up and running.

Maybe future updates will be to add a radio stream player and to use the light sensor to turn the display off at night.

raspberry_pi,Webcam and video conferencing,"I’m relatively new to Raspberry Pi. I got a Pi 4 this summer to host my Plex server, and after a fair amount of following online instruction and some experimentation I was able to get it to work. I learned a few basic commands along the way, but I mostly use the Windows style GUI for navigation and access it remotely via VNC from my Windows machine or phone and curate my files remotely as well.

I recently picked up a USB webcam from Amazon hoping to use it for video conferencing. It’s not fancy ($15). I was having power issues with my media hard drives, so I also picked up a powered USB hub hoping that might also help with the webcam. I’m aware that most video chatting software isn’t available for ARM based computers, so I was trying to access Skype via the web client. I haven’t, however, been able to get Skype to recognize the webcam and allow video or audio. Since the camera has a microphone built in, Raspberry OS seems to recognize it as a source of audio input. I still have not had any luck with the webcam.

Since I’m new to Raspberry Pi, I’m not sure if maybe I’m not understanding something about the webcam, be it drivers or hardware related. I thought USB would be plug and play. I’m also not married to Skype if that’s part of the problem. I don’t know of any ways to do testing of the hardware. I’m open to anything if anyone has some insights or suggestions.

I’m new to this subreddit and frankly, new to Raspberry Pi in general. To give a little background, one of my best friends (a brother of mine is a more apt description) recently passed away from a very short battle with pancreatic cancer, 6 weeks from diagnosis to passing. 

I’ve been thinking of different ways to honor his memory as well as to mimic his minimalist lifestyle (he had no funeral, his body was donated to the university, his remains will be cremated, and his final resting place will be spread in a number of places, while his remaining ashes will be many states away). He was a IT director so I have been thinking of using a Raspberry Pi build to do some folding@home project surrounding cancer research which would ultimately be powered by solar energy.

My thinking is to make a headless Raspberry Pi with the F@H client running on it. The final goal is to have solar panels send power to one or more Li-ion battery packs that would power the Raspberry Pi. 

I’d love some advice on how to build something like this."

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 400: An utterly unusable catastropic mess of a desktop experience?,"Hi all,

I am a long time Pi developer and user. Just recently bought a Raspberry Pi 400 for testing, which came with an official Pi SD image installation of a Raspbian 10 Buster.

Trying out the Pi 400 desktop, I find some really puzzling bugs, so obvious that one begins to wonder however this kind of thing could have passed QA, and/or if my unit is just defective.

The issues begin with the mouse. The Pi misses half of the mouse clicks, and I have to repeatedly click on the menu items and icons for it to register. If seems that if I hold down a mouse button for a longer period of time, it will work better.

Then, it looks like mouse button releases are registered delayed. For example, if I drag a window on the desktop, and wiggle it moving left to right, then release the mouse button, and then move my mouse cursor upwards after having released the mouse, one would expect that the window would get released, and then the mouse would continue moving up.

But instead what happens is that the mouse window will continue being dragged upwards along with the mouse cursor, even though I had already released the mouse.

It is as if the mouse buttons are unsynchronized between the mouse cursor coordinates, and are processed out-of-order with mouse movement motion.

**These issues (missed clicks, desync position vs clicks) could be explained if the OS was polling mouse input, rather than using buffered mouse input.**

I see a number of issues on the web about slow wireless mouses, though I am testing with a good old **wired** mouse (which does not exhibit any of these issues while plugged in to other PCs).

Then, the issues do not stop there.

When typing on the keyboard, the experience is equally as horrible as with the mouse. The build quality of the keyboard feels nice for a compact build, that's nice! However, when typing up any document, the Pi frequently either misses keyboard keys that I have pressed, or duplicates keyboard keys that I have pressed, even though keyboard repeat delay is set to the default value, which is like a second+ until repeat should occur.

**Again, this could be explained if the Pi was polling for keyboard state, instead of implementing proper buffered keyboard reads.**

Is that what is really happening here? If so, \*what\* \*a\* \*facepalm\*.

I am really surprised by this since I do not recall earlier Pis having this issue. (although I mostly work via command line and SSH, so my time with physical keyboard + mouse on the Pi has been limited)

Finally, when I launch a built-in bundled game like Boing, the gameplay experience is quite horrible: the ball is stuttering about 2 times a second, instead of producing a smooth panning movement animation on screen. I wonder if the game implementation is at fault or what, though looking at top, the game does not seem to be particularly taxing on the Pi.

Would really have expected this to be the Pi's finest hour, but looks like they are still not there. :("

raspberry_pi,A bunch of noob questions about my new Pi 4,"  

Got a raspberry pi 4 for retorpie and retro gaming. I’m having a few issues that I wanted help with here. I put on all of the old systems and games on, and then I added a bunch of PS1 and Dreamcast games. 256gb card. I’m a big noob by the way.

I loaded lots of Dreamcast and PS1 games, and at some point the games stopped transferring from my usb stick to the Pi 4. 

1. If you try to load games onto a pi 4 from a usb stick, if the memory is full does it just stop loading? Or does it let you know? 

2. How do you delete games from the Retropie OS?

3. N64 games run too choppy. What is the current best overclocking guide? And I have a small fan on my Pi 4 case, will I need more than that if I overclock it? Is there a recommended overclock setting to run N64 games that doesn’t get too hot? 

4. Some of my NES games are a little jumpy/choppy too. Is that possibly because my memory card is full? Would overclocking help this?"

I'm looking to run a Bitcoin node, and [according to the list here](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz) (see under ""Hardware Needed"") they recommend the [ScanDisk SSD](https://shop.westerndigital.com/en-ca/products/internal-drives/sandisk-ssd-plus-sata-iii-ssd#SDSSDA-1T00-G26). Does it really matter or can I go with something cheaper like a [Team Group GX2 SSD](https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/product/gx2)? I can get the latter for $50 less"

raspberry_pi,2020 Dec 21 Stickied 𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊 thread - Boot problems? Display problems? Networking problems? Need ideas? Get help with these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/kda8q5/2020_dec_14_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Connect To Two WiFi Networks Simultaneously,"Hi. I'm trying to use a Pi to control a GoPro over WiFi and send the pictures to a a web server. Initially I was connecting to to Go Pro's wifi, taking the picture with the [gopro-py-api](https://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-py-api), and then connecting to my home wifi to send the image to the server. This turned out to have some complications.

I read that it should be possible to connect the Pi to two wifis at the same time - home and Go Pro in my case - so I bought a USB WiFi Adapter to try that. Several days later I still haven't figured it out. Graphically I can see the second wifi point and the Go Pro wifi but it won't connect. I've also tried configuring wpa_supplicant.conf and etc/network/interfaces to no avail.

First 
SD card corruption
Yes pi has corrupted 2 of my sd card the only solution was to use ssd to boot.
If they had included a tiny battery just enough for a proper shutdown it could have been avoided

Second
Overheating damaged my pen drive
A tiny fan could have avoided all this

Third
Risk of electric shock nothing major though
A cheap tiny housing just enough to cover exposed metal parts could have avoided all this

Pi should come with optional emmc support because sd cards are junk to run a os and sooner or later they will die
Fans must be mandatory 
Also a tiny battery could have kept those sd cards alive

They should have a model for everyday enthusiast which could make sure no damage to users is caused no matter how unintentional

In short
Don't use your pi without fan and with a sd card"

raspberry_pi,Questions around Raspberry Pi 4 as a NAS,"Hi all, I'm really hoping you guys can help me out!

I'm looking at getting a RP4 to use as a NAS on my home network. I currently have a RP3 as a Time Machine/PiHole. 

I would usually have no problem doing this myself, but I have a couple of issues that I need to overcome. 

1. I already have a hard disk with a large amount on music formatted in HFS+. Reformatting this to work with Netatalk isn't an option.
2. It has to be compatible with Bonjour services
3. The drive has to be removable. This drive is my primary music library, so being able to remove it so I can take it on the go is essential.

Like I said, being able to create a new Netatalk NAS server isn't a problem, but being able to do these other things is proving quite a challenge!

I hope you guys can help! TIA"

raspberry_pi,Beginner electronics: Measure gpio output voltage with a multimeter?,"When I use a multimeter to read out the 3.3V or 5.0V pins, connecting multimeter to one of them and GND on the rpi4b, I get a brief flash of expected output (3.3V or 5.0V) but then a steady 1V?

Is this normal, expected? If an actual device (like a led + resistor) were connected, would the power stay at a higher voltage, and this is just a consequence of the measuring method?

Context:

I'm following this guide to get a suspend/wake up button and a running status indicator led for my rpi 4b: https://www.embedded-computing.com/guest-blogs/raspberry-pi-power-up-and-shutdown-with-a-physical-button

I'm having trouble with this bit:
```
For this purpose I added an LED across BCM pin 4 and a ground, then turned it on at (...) with the line gpio=4=op,dh instead added to /boot/config.txt 
```

Now connecting a multimeter to pins 6 (GND) and 7 (gpio4), I get 0 without the line in boot/config, but with it I get 1V, the article suggests that the gpio4 pin would output the 3.3V?"

raspberry_pi,Streaming video from OpenCV with GStreamer over UDP to PC,"Hi everyone,

I'm trying to stream a video that has been processed by OpenCV using GStreamer over UDP from a RPi4 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 64bit without any GUI) to a PC (Ubuntu 18.04).

I'm sharing Wifi connection to the RPi by ethernet (PC address : 10.42.0.1 and RPi address : 10.42.0.18). It worked using TCP with the following sender pipeline:

`appsrc !  videoconvert !  x264enc tune=zerolatency speed-preset=ultrafast !  rtph264pay config-interval=10 pt=96 !  mpegtsmux !  tcpserversink host=``10.42.0.18` `port=6969`

But I can't get it to work using UDP with this pipeline :

`appsrc !  videoconvert !  x264enc tune=zerolatency speed-preset=ultrafast !  rtph264pay config-interval=10 pt=96 !  udpsink host=``10.42.0.1` `port=6969`

By analyzing my network, I can see that the RPi is sending the data over ethernet so I think the problem come from my receiver pipeline which is this one :

`gst-launch-1.0 -v -e udpsrc port=6969 caps = ""application/x-rtp, media=(string)video, clock-rate=(int)90000, encoding-name=(string)H264, format=BGR, payload=(int)96"" ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 lowres=1 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink`

When I run it, nothing append, it just waits. But by sniffing my 6969 port on my PC I can see the data coming:

    tcpdump -n udp port 6969
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on enp3s0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

I tried I think almost every solutions offered by my many Google searches, none worked.

The GStreamer version on the PC is 1.14.5, the GStreamer version on the RPi is 1.16.2.

Thanks for your help!"

raspberry_pi,I made a raspberry pi controlled gnome home geocache,"WARNING - if you are a geocacher in Minnesota and you don't want a spoiler, DO NOT READ AHEAD

For anybody who doesn't know, geocaching is a game where you hide a container somewhere and people use GPS coordinates to find it. It's a little bit of a treasure hunt and a little bit of a hide &amp; seek game. One of the rules of the game is that you have to be able to access the logbook and sign it to prove you were there, in order to count it as a legitimate find. So sometimes there are puzzles or locks to figure out before you can do so, this ups the difficulty and allows people to be creative.

I've had a vision for a unique cache for some time where the actual geocache is locked with a lock and you need the key to open it. In order to get the key, you need to visit a gnome home and knock on the door to ask him to give you the key. When you do, it'll open a spring loaded drawer that spits out and has the key in it.

I'm putting the finishing touches on it and wanted to share some pictures with you all. I wasn't really thinking about sharing this when I was making it so I didn't take pictures of every step, but I have some here.

If there's any interest I may update this posting with some code snippets later.

The way that it works is a little complicated:

1. There is a drawer that has the key in it. In its normal state, the drawer is locked and you can't open it just by pulling on it.

2. There is a latch that holds the drawer closed. Side note here, I needed to get creative with the latch because I found it had a tendency to open too far and also not return back into place on gravity alone. So a set screw keeps the travel from going too far and there's a spring that pushes it back in place when it needs to close. I also needed for this to return to a locked position when it was done, but allow for the person finding it to be able to insert the drawer back after it was already in the locked/down position. So a gate latch was the perfect piece.

3. When it comes time to open the latch, there's a servo that is connected to the top of the latch with fishing line that pulls it in the right direction. This opens the latch, the latch disengages the drawer, then the servo spins back and the spring in the latch returns it back to the locked position.

4. The thing that tells the servo to run is a raspberry pi zero, via the GPIO headers.

5. There is also an audio sensor that when it senses sound, it goes into a low voltage state. This is how the raspberry pi knows a sound event happened, by monitoring the GPIO headers for the low voltage state.

6. The entire thing is encased in a custom made gnome home that I built out of a log and a bunch of wood (boring out the underside was a ridiculous challenge.

7. It is placed an area that has constant power, so the pi is always on.

8. The pi runs a combination of scripts. The main one is a simple php loop that constantly monitors the GPIO headers for changes. When it detects enough noise, it tells the servo to run forward, then backward via a python script. This is also logged in a local log file I can retrieve to check for false positive sound events. There is some bit of sleeping, cooldown, resetting the counter, etc that goes on here that's a little bit difficult to explain, but it exists so that the servo wont be running randomly. Basically I'm trying very very very hard to mitigate false positive latch releases.

9. The entire unit sits atop a structure made of pressure treated wood to prevent decay. It is also caulked in every conceivable place water may try to enter, trying to keep everything dry and in working order.

10. Just for extra safety, the power source is on a GFCI outlet, just in case of a short, nobody is going to get hurt.

11. I had some trouble getting the sensitivity of the sound sensor to trigger correctly. It actually wants more of a steady sound than a knocking (quiet, loud, quiet, loud). So I ended up adding a door knocker to the structure to make it work a little better for the finder.

If all goes according to plan, they visit the site, knock on the  unit or with the knocker, the sound sensor notices, tells the pi, the pi tells the servo to run, the latch is opened, and the drawer spits out with the key. They then use the key to open up the ammo can sitting next to it and enjoy the experience.

Hope you enjoyed! This project took me probably 30 hours to build.

Here is the php snippet that runs constantly:

    &lt;?php
    $max_retries = 300;
    $knocks = 0;
    $retries = 0;
    while(1==1) {
      echo ""RETRIES: "".$retries."" | KNOCKS: "".$knocks.""\n"";
      $retries++;
      if($retries&gt;$max_retries) {
        $retries=0;
        $knocks=0;
      }
      if(system(""gpio read 4"")==0) {
        $knocks++;
        if($knocks &gt;= 3) {
          system(""python /home/pi/open.py"");
          $today = date(""Y-m-d H:i:s"");
          file_put_contents(""/var/www/html/log.txt"", ""LATCH OPENED: "".$today.""\n"", FILE_APPEND);
          $knocks=0;
          $retries=0;
          sleep(60);
        }
      }
      sleep(.5);
    }
    
    ?&gt;
    

Here is the python script code that tells the servo to move all the way one way then back:

    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    import time
    import os
    
    GPIO.setwarnings(False)
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
    GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.OUT)
    Servo = GPIO.PWM(11, 50)
    Servo.start(2.5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    Servo.ChangeDutyCycle(12.5)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    Servo.stop()

Lastly, here is my crontab that makes it all come together. Note, I have a habit of restarting my pis every day at midnight. I dunno, maybe I'm just paranoid about memory leaks and such, but it seems to help.

    0 0 * * * sudo reboot
    @reboot sudo php /home/pi/runit.php

So sorry I don't have a pinout for you. I only ever took one picture of it and it wasn't very clear. It would be far too difficult to take apart now, unfortunately. I remember struggling with pin # vs GPIO # vs what the raspberry pi utility wants. It took some trial and error but I ended up getting it. The servo runs off 5v I believe and the sound sensor runs off 3v. Then there is ground, and then the corresponding GPIO headers, one each for the servo and one for the sound sensor."

raspberry_pi,Need help with electric/wiring to GPIO pins,"First, I want to preface by saying I did check /r/AskElectronics and checked their sub rules which say if you are working with a raspberry pi you should post to this sub, so I am trying here.

I have never used the GPIO pins on the raspberry pi before and I am trying to get into my first project for a video doorbell. I bought [this switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079GK565N) as the doorbell button, and I cut up a power adapter I had laying around from some old router or something. I twisted the wires and used electrical tape to connect the power adapter to the switch, and it behaves as desired on its own - LED normally lit, turns off when pressed. 

However when I plug the other end of the switch (blue/blue wires from switch, connected to my red/brown jumper wires) into my RPI4B and tested it, I must have killed it. I read the RPI4B boot troubleshooting [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151#p1485558) and tested booting up with nothing but power connected, and I don't get the 4 flashes that indicate it can't read the files on the missing sdcard. That redirected me to [The Seven Things That Will Instantly Destroy Your Rpi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=83372&amp;p=1250211#p1467093), where I am guessing I did this:

&gt; Firstly: any voltage greater than about four (4.0) Volt applied to any of the GPIO pins will cause ... a local short between the (3V3) power line and GND which overheats and burns up more silicon, which only ends when power is removed. 

My power adapter says Output:12V on it, so I am guessing I applied 12V where I should only apply 4V. So my question is **How do I convert the power from my adapter from 12V to 4V before it reaches the RPI4?** Secondly, is there anything else I am doing wrong to cause damage to the RPI? I have one more RPI4 left and I don't want to kill it.

1. SuperVisor Frontend Service\[1\]
2. SuperVisor Driver Service\[2\]

You can find my last post here\[3\] where I wrote a remotely accessible system performance monitoring and task management tool using Flask Web Microframework which managed to do a lot with less memory and processing usage. With 148 stars at the time of writing this, the tool\[4\] was lauded by everyone and it was even featured in a Tom's Hardware news article\[5\] and Awesome RPi\[6\] list too. You are an awesome community, r/raspberry_pi! &lt;3

[With SuperVisor, the application now aims to be more mature in terms of both modularity, efficiency and power](https://preview.redd.it/novqgld4kr561.png?width=1389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14bb41592c38c9e6bc2eb7f397142c25c3a5d362)

With so much attention, I was led to think of ways as to how I can make my project serve its purpose in a much better way. Gave in tons of thinking and some lines of code, I was able to rewrite **SYSMON** into **SuperVisor** with tons of exciting features like the following added and improved upon.

1. Phased out boring donut charts and progress bars in favour of awesome and exciting charts to get insights about how performance is changing with respect to time.
2. Made realtime system information fetching greatly efficient by reducing overhead to half amounts transmitted per second with zero dependence on templating using DeadSync.
3. Decoupled the monitoring subsystem from the web interface subsystem so one driver endpoint can connect to multiple frontends and vice versa. (Thank you u/M8HacKr for your suggestion about controlling multiple Pis from single frontend)
4. Said goodbye to Flask and hello to net/http implementation in Go for awesome load times and reduced latency in asset fetching with just 512KB of RAM usage. (Thank you u/lastminutedash for your suggestion to make the system incredibly lightweight)
5. The driver endpoint was entirely rewritten in Falcon and Werkzeug to monitor and dispatch system performance while providing controlled access to insights and task management using passcode. (Feel free to take a look u/queBurro!)
6. Releases for x86\_64 and aarch64 are readily available. For other architectures, there is support for installation using Docker Compose and building from the script. Feel free to contribute to add dedicated releases for other architectures!

My question is, if I navigate to the samba server and try to compile a .Tex file whose processor is being used to execute it? The laptop or the pi? 

Just to clarify (for my sanity), the software (TexMaker) is installed in the laptop, but the file .Tex is stored in the Pi.

The reason I ask is that I am trying to work off remotely rather than store stuff in my laptop. This allows me to continue working on my desktop sometimes. But when using the samba, it is very slow to compile."

raspberry_pi,External HDD wont show up in dmesg when inserted in USB3.0 slot on Rpi4,"Hi all,

trying to get one specific external HDD to work when inserted into one of the USB 3.0 ports but I'm having a surprisingly hard time. The USB 2.0 ports are working fine but are limiting my throughput. Another external (2.5 inch) HDD is working fine on the USB 3.0 ports. What surprises me the most is that it just wont show up in dmesg or any of of the following: lsusb, lsblk or /dev/sd\*

Hardware:

* Raspi4b with 4 GB RAM
   * uname -a: Linux raspi4b 5.4.0-1025-raspi #28-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT Wed Dec 9 17:10:53 UTC 2020 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
* External HDD 3.5 inch with additional12V 1.5A power supply and USB 3.0 cable

Observation:

* After inserting the USB cable into any of the USB 3.0 slots, the HDD starts spinning up
* dmesg shows nothing new in the log, neither do lsusb, lsblk or /dev/sd\*

What I tried so far:

* use USB 2.0 ports (with success, but low throughput)
* use USB 3.0 port on my desktop under windows (with success and expected speed)
* insert another 2.5 inch USB 3.0 hdd into an USB 3.0 port (dmesg, lsusb and lsblk all show the HDD, is mountable)
* deleted ntfs partition with fdisk and created a new ext4 formated partition with mkfs.ext4 on usb 2.0 port (still does not show up on USB 3.0)
* Researches only showed defect cables (cable works on desktop), low current on spin-up (works on USB 2.0) and a buggy kernel on ubuntu that only works with 1, 2 or 3 gigs of ram (fixed by now, also the other HDD does work)

I'm clueless at this point and guessing that the controller of my device is just not up to its task or something... Can't really post any logs because none will be generated with the misfunctioning hdd.

Any help would be appreaciated, I will try to add any required logs asap"

raspberry_pi,File system for NAS?,"I've managed to get a samba server running on my pi4 with a external drive enclosure and a couple of 4TB drives.

I'm going to use it for backing up a couple of windows PC's and all of my media. Also hosting a plex server.

I initially set it up as a Raid 1 with both drives mirrored, using the hardware raid on the external enclosure. I formated the drives to ext4 and was getting 70-80 MB/s speeds sending files to the NAS over my network. 

I ended up screwing something up (possibly my FSTAB) and my pi stopped booting.

I decided to start over with a fresh raspian install and this time I took the drives out of Raid and formated them to NTFS, which felt more comfortable since if the pi fails I can just grab the drives and plug them into my PC to get to my backups.

The problem with this is that my speeds are awful now. 10MB/s max when transferring to the pi. I'm pretty sure that the choke point is the file system. If I plug the enclosure into my PC I get 100 MB/s speeds all day.

So what would you guys recommend? Is there a file system that is natively supported in windows but not super slow on the pi?

Should I mix the drives? Have one formatted EXT4 and the other NTFS? Then make the pi back the EXT drive up to the NTFS drive?"

raspberry_pi,Threading / RTOS with RPi?,"Background: I'm working on a project where we want to record all the data from an IMU, but also use that data (i.e. if we pass some critical threshold) to control a motor (possibly 4, the size of the project hasn't been wilted down yet, that's a colleague's job).  

It was suggested to me to run the IMU reading in an independent thread so that we could have even sampling times, and this would be passed to another thread to run some data analysis (beyond the scope of my direct involvement) and do some other magic to get an estimate of the state vector, then control of the motor would be based on this.

In my own research for this, I've read about mutlithreading in C with pthreads which seems to be doable, but I've also been reading that the RPi does not have (by default) a real time operating system.  Assuming multithreading in C is fine, will the RPi be able ""dynamically"" control the motor fast enough in response to changes in the IMU readings?  I definitely don't understand all of these all the way, I've patched together my understanding from the RPi forums.  Is a RTOS something I need to worry about? Does using threads sound fine/doable/necessary for this application of real time control of 1-4 motors based on the data of 1 sensor?

For reference, this is taking place on a RPi 0 W (so only 1 core, not like the RPi 3 with quadcore CPU).  I'm a bit new to the deeper software implementation (I've only used Python, so C and multithreading are new to me, although I understand you can also use threads in Python but C is faster), appreciate any help!"

Hey guys,

I thought it would be nice if I posted this project here.

I developed a small nodejs driver and graphics library for those 3.5 lcd screens found on aliexpress.

This's meant for developers to have direct access to the LCD, not to use it as a normal monitor.

The graphic lib has some utilities to paint circles, rects, images, texts (using BMFont), buttons and scrolls.

If you want to add compatibility to your own LCD I'd be glad to help.

Next to that proyect I'm developing a fluidsynth wrapper with UI directly painted to the LCD, that way you can have a headless raspbian and still use the screen for it. You can check onto the first version of that project here: [https://gitlab.com/bastiyang/lcdsynth](https://gitlab.com/bastiyang/lcdsynth)"

I was thinking it may be more stable to capture only still images. I work with video for a living and can place stills in a Premiere timeline and make a timelapse video with that. Why tax the little Pi Zero with making that video file anyway?

Storage may be an issue, even at 1024 by 768, I imagine I can pull the images off every few days with VNC? Or upload them to Dropbox?

I'm running deluge-web on debian server with user ""martin"" , when i download a torrent it cant be accessed . It does download though. When i do sudo chmod -R 777 on the share i can access it. But how can i directly make the debian ""martin"" user access the files to on the pi share."

raspberry_pi,Sleepy Pi 2 Question,"What's everyone's opinion on the sleepy pi 2? I'm asking because I built a mini arcade machine and want it to run off wireless unless it's charging. I bought a pihat juice and it works except it's always on and the battery dies very quickly on standby.  
So my only choices are to find a way to wire it to shut the pi completely off somehow or to get the sleepy pi 2 and hope it works for what I want. But I can't find any reviews or videos on it. What would you suggest?

  
Thanks!"
raspberry_pi,How do I configure eth0 as a tagged port allowing all vlans?,"I've struggled to find out how to configure eth0 as a tagged port (802.1q) allowing all vlans so that I can plug it into a switchport that is receiving mirrored traffic from a port that is connected to a Unifi-USG with about 5 Vlans. All vlans are routed at the USG. I have Wireshark running on a 4GB Ram RPI 4. For now, I'm using the WiFi port to connect to the Pi. 

Every search led to how to configure a vlan, etc. I do not want eth0 to get a DHCP address. In the Windows world it would be an 802.1q port with all vlans added but unconfigured as far as DHCP."

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/k8uf7l/2020_dec_7_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it? How powerful is it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,probably dumb question surrounding running an endless loop with a flask web server,"Hello there,  
I currently have a endless loop on my pi, which is grabbing data from open weather maps and presenting the data onto a LCD screen. I'm not able to screenshot the code, but effectively it runs a main function, which setsup the GPIO pin, and then changes the time and weather of the ""clock"" via 2 functions. That bit works fine!  


Now, i have it turning on and off at certain times in the day to not disrupt sleep etc. I want a web portal in which I can set these times nicely, rather than have them hard coded in. I have looked into flask and followed this tutorial:

[https://www.instructables.com/Python-WebServer-With-Flask-and-Raspberry-Pi/](https://www.instructables.com/Python-WebServer-With-Flask-and-Raspberry-Pi/)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

to the point of having a template show up when i go to the URL. Perfect!  
Now, when i try to merge that code into mine, with the file saved in the same location, it doesn't show up when i go to the url, and i get a 401 error. for reference, in my script i am calling main() within the if \_\_name\_\_==""\_\_main\_\_"", so i just put the [app.run](https://app.run) above that, and added the rest into my code.  


Any help would be massively appreciated, it feels so close but a too far for me to work out"

raspberry_pi,"Can't access other devices over network, only via router unit","I  recently set up my Raspberry Pi to act as a router. All is working well  when it comes to connected devices accessing the internet. The problem  is that my computers don't seem to be allowed/capable of communicating  with each other.

Device map:

* Router Pi (a Raspberry Pi 4, set up as a router)
* Computer Pi (a Raspberry Pi 3)
* Desktop Computer (a desktop computer running Linux)

**Both the** ***Computer Pi*** **and the** ***Desktop Computer*** **is connected to** ***Router Pi*** **over WiFi.**

For example, when trying to open ssh between *Desktop Computer* and *Computer Pi*, i receive the following message:

    ssh user@192.168.4.4 
    ssh: connect to host 192.168.4.4 port 22: No route to host 

However, the following **works**:

* ssh to *Router Pi* from *Desktop Computer*.
* ssh to *Computer Pi* from *Router Pi*

This is the output of my iptables configuration, since I suspect it  might have to do with this. Here I also tried to allow ssh connections  by adding a rule, but it doesn't seem to have affected anything.

    sudo iptables -L 
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination
    ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:ssh
    
    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination
    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT) target     prot opt source               destination         

So, to the question: **What could prohibit the devices from accessing one another?**

raspberry_pi,Yet another question about powering clusters,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, this is yet another question about powering RPi clusters. However, in my case, I already have the parts to power the cluster, though I'm on the fence of what to do and need some advice on how to best use what I have available or possible alternatives that you have yourself used.

I had been wanting to build a RPi cluster for quite some time and as the pandemic-induced lockdowns came into play, I decided I would start to slowly order all the parts to build it. My main focus with this build has always been to build the smallest possible cluster, with the less amount of power use possible, keeping it as cool as possible (cool as in cold, not looks, though that also plays a part obviously).

You can find a sort of build log here: [https://imgur.com/a/h0VlMBv](https://imgur.com/a/h0VlMBv)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so now to my question/doubt part:

I have multiple ways of powering the Pis, all of them with upsides and downsides, so I was hoping some previous experience could be useful for this conversation.

1. 4x Official Pi PSU (5V 3A)
2. Leicke 50W (5V 10A) laptop-style PSU + 2.1mm DC female --&gt; 4x 2.1mm DC male + 2.1mm DC female --&gt; USB-C male ([this one from Amazon.es](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B07YVBHH6K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1))
3. [Pirl Charger](https://www.pirlcharger.com/) \- 4x (5V 2.7A) USB-A output. You can see this in the photos from imgur

&amp;#x200B;

All of them have upsides and downsides:

1. &amp;#x200B;
   1. Upside: Guaranteed to work and support the 3A Pis might need
   2. Downside: Requires multiple available power sockets, defeating the small size objective.
2. &amp;#x200B;
   1. Upside: Can power the Pis (or LED strips, or anything in the 5V range like mobile phones)
   2. Downside: Requires splitters and adapters, making it ugly. ""Only"" 10A. Still a bit bigger than I'd like.
3. &amp;#x200B;
   1. Upside: Guaranteed 2.7A per port (better than the usual 2.4 from ""regular"" adapters like the ones from Anker and the likes). Also, power use is displayed on the 7-segment screen.
   2. Downside: Requires a power input in the range of 7-17V (clearly, the Leicke one is not enough). Generates some heat ([see the review](https://lygte-info.dk/review/USBpower%20Pirl%20Charger%204x2.7A%20usb.html))"

raspberry_pi,A USB switch that breaks both data and power lines,"I have just begun to play with the Raspberry Pi, specifically a 2B that boots into 'RISCOS Open'.

For the sake of convenience I have its video output and that of my desktop passed through an HDMI switch to my monitor. I would like the same utility to share my keyboard/trackball, but obviously through a USB switch in their case. Towards this end I picked up a 'Sabrent USB 2.0 Sharing Switch' for pennies from Amazon the other day and at first it appeared to do the job very well. The device did seem to properly toggle the input from my peripherals to either device on command. However... I was rather surprized to find that when I disconnected power from my Raspberry Pi the thing remained powered up!

A little experimentation showed the Raspberry Pi was actually drawing power 'back down' the USB peripheral cable... Effectively it seemed the Sabrent switch joined the power lines of both its input ports regardless of which gang it was switched to... This seems a ***spectacularly*** bad design decision!!! I am only pleased that no badly referenced transient from the Raspberry Pi PSU did not cook my desktop USB bus!

I have done some searching but there seems to be no specification on any of the other USB switches I found whether they do indeed break both power and data lines. I wonder if any of you chaps have put together a similar setup and could recommend a switch that works in a more electrically sane fashion?

As an aside I did consider modifying the PCB on the Sabrent to place a pair of SMT Schottky diodes on the power lines that connect the Raspberry Pi side of the input. However I worry the diode voltage drop would cause instability. Plus if I am honest it has been a long, *long* time since I did any serious electronics and I have probably forgotten what I am talking about anyway!!!"

**Raspberry Pi devices** can do almost anything you can **come up with.**  Here is a collage of some of my work.  You can read all my work on my [blog](https://hashnode.com/@mooredvd), over on Medium where I write a [series for Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/dofromscratch). Combining with the Arduino really extends the range of sensors and there are all sorts of HATS available which control power, signalling,  and the whole GIPO capabilities.

Can these be powered from the raspberrypi, or do I need a separate power supply? I am also confused on if the data input would need to be changed as well, from what I understand it is sent out of the pi at 3.3 volts which might not be read by the led strip. Would I need a logic level converter if this is the case? How should I power the led strip? Any help is greatly appreciated from anyone thank you!!

raspberry_pi,Pi zero W: Connecting over USB with arch linux (no GUI),"The title might need some explanation:

I run arch linux with the i3 desktop environment, and I dont use `NetworkManager` (i use `iwd` instead). therefore i am unable to set the rpi ethernet interface to link-local using a GUI (like most of the guides online have you do). 

When I flashed my raspian image, i made sure to add the `ssh` file to the boot partition, and did the necessary edits to `config.txt` and `cmdline.txt` to enable the ssh connection over USB. 

Now, when I plug in the pi zero and wait for it to boot, i notice that a new interface appears when i run `ip a` but it says that its down. I will have a screenshot of what that looks like [here](https://imgur.com/a/MJb7nAW)

I have looked at several questions on the rpi stack exchange that say to use `ifconfig` to enable link-local, but after following along I am unable to connect to the rpi over ssh. 

for further information, when i try to connect to `pi@raspberrypi.local` the error is as follows

`ssh: Could not resolve hostname raspberrypi.local: Temporary failure in name resolution` 

if there is anything unclear about the problem i am happy to provide more info, im not sure exactly what the problem is or what i am doing wrong."

raspberry_pi,/tmp and /var/log as tmpfs to save I/O cycles on my sd card --&gt; good idea?,"Hello,

I read some time ago that is a good idea to modify in `/etc/fstab`  `/temp` and `/var/log` as [tmpfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt) to limit the read/write access to the sd card and extend the life span of my sd card.

Due to the fact that everything is deleted `/temp` and `/var/log` after a reboot and in I now have a service (nginx) which needs on startup the existence of `/var/log/nginx` and the files `error.log` and `access.log` I'm unsure whether [tmpfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt) makes still sense or not.

Is there probably a better way to extend the life span of my sd card?"

raspberry_pi,Unix Benchmark Deathmatch: Raspberry Pi 4 vs SparcStation 20.,"Yesterday I got curious how much faster a RaspBerry Pi 4 was than a Sparcstation 1. It was the hottest workstation around in the day, at least till the HP snake. 

Google was not up to this task, but I did find an article comparing the RP1 and RP2 to a SS20. They used an old Unix benchmark written by BYTE magazine back in the day.

* http://eschatologist.net/blog/?p=266
* **Raspberry Pi vs SPARCstation 20: Fight!**
* A lot can happen in 20 years. Even when it comes to things like I/O throughput, where the Raspberry Pi really falls down compared to other systems — because it attaches to everything via USB — it’s still way faster than a mid-1990s Sun that we all thought was extremely fast.

* In particular, according to the indexes, a Raspberry Pi is about seven times as fast as a baseline SPARCstation 20 model 61 — and has substantially more RAM and storage, too. And the Raspberry Pi 2 is sixteen times as fast at single-threaded tasks, and on tasks where all cores can be put to use it’s forty one times faster.

Interestingly, they have links to the Unix Benchmark program, cool, so we can now compare it to a 4GB RP4. The benchmark compiled with some errors (like just everything else), but except for some unitilized variable errors in some printf commands, it seems to run OK. This is a long test, I did not time it, but it was at least 30 min.

The results...

Computer|SS5|SS20|UltraSparcII 296Mhz Ram 512M|RP1|RP2|RP4
x1 test|16.5|10|16.3|71.9|165.6|266.6
x4 test|||||417.4|731.2

Note: I think the x4 test was added at a much later date, which is why there are no x4 results from earlier computers. I found 2 more Sparc results from google and added them in. Also, I don't think they have the right model for the Baseline system (score is defined as 10) if a SS5 is faster, the computer they ran the benchmark against might indeed be a SS1.

By this benchmark the RP4 is only 2-3x as fast as the RP2. So that says a lot just by itself."

I managed to run my openvpn client with my desired config manually and I managed to run automatically after booting.  
I considered using tap0 instead of tun0 and bridging the wlan0 and tun0 via br0 but it seems like that doesn't work either.

I installed RaspAP + openvpn and tried to modify the iptables as well as with ufw but I either get the VPN to run and the wlan to not work or I get the wlan to run but the traffic not going through the VPN.

My Setup looks like this: eth: [192.168.1.2](https://192.168.1.2) gateway [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) wlan0 [192.168.10.0/24](https://192.168.10.0/24) DHCP

raspberry_pi,My Home Lab Home and Usenet Automation Cluster,"[Pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/VXahpBj)

Thought I'd take a moment to share my 3-node Home-lab cluster. I'm a fairly heavy Plex user, and had built of a small army of tools that were running ""natively"" on my old Synology DS414play. The Synology wasn't ever great at running this stuff, and I was frequently having to log in and fight with services failing or not starting, etc. I wanted something that was more stable, and that I could use to monitor the health of those services. 

My requirements for this project were:

1. All services must be in a docker container
2. All data must be managed in a way that destroying or moving a container among nodes maintains data persistence (see the last pic in the album for some explanation)
3. All configuration must be managed by Ansible 
4. All config must be in my [GitHub repo](http://github.com/jehanalvani/fustercluck/issues)

Managing Synology via the CLI sucks, so I omit NFS export management from my Ansible requirement. The Synology also currently acts as a reverse-proxy so I can access some services from outside my network. 

On the 3b+ I keep things that _have_ to run: eg. Homebridge. That's currently how my family does all sort of stuff including opening and closing our garage door. 

One of the 4's is dedicated to databases containers: InfluxDB and Prometheus TSDBs. The other 4 runs all of the application[^1] containers. I expected the DBs to be more resource intensive than they are, so I could probably rebalance more sensibly. 

Every node runs a cAdvisor container to monitor itself and the other containers. Prometheus scrapes them all. Tautulli runs in a container on the Mac mini with the Plex container, Varken reads Tautulli, and pumps metrics to Influx, so I have details about the activities of Plex/Sonarr/Radarr in Grafana. It's pretty sweet. 

The display on the dashboard pi is a [Pimoroni HyperPixel 4.0 touch](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4?variant=12569485443155), and it's just gorgeous. I almost feel bad using it for this. The non-touch version would be awesome in a retropie setup.

raspberry_pi,Unable to connect a Rii i8+ Mini Bluetooth Keyboard with Touchpad＆QWERTY Keyboard to my new Pi 4b.,"Hello everyone! Hope all is well in your neighborhoods.

So I got my first Raspberry Pi (4b) this week.  I got the awesome little guy setup almost immediately.  Overclocked it.  Setup vnc.  Setup my temperature monitor and fan.  And boom! Everything is running like a champ... except... this [Rii i8+ Mini bluetooth Keyboard and touchpad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GCPVZDW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).  

For some reason, I cannot get it to pair or connect even with it plugged directly into USB.  First thing I did of course was check the bluetooth on Rasbian and the Pi itself. Everything appears to be working okay. But, I'm still a bit of a noob with the Pi. And to a slightly lesser extent, Linux. 

So I decided to try it out on a different computer.  It works flawless in Mac OS X Catalina and Windows 10.  So, I've deduced that its not the Rii i8+.  I also decided to try an alternative route while playing around and installed Ubuntu Mate on a separate SD card and attempted to connect after it installed.  Unfortunately, same result.  Wired or wireless does not connect.

On the Ubuntu Mate side it shows up in the Bluetooth list and settings, but when I try to pair it says that it [Connection Failed: Input/output error](https://imgur.com/a/XoIRg0p). Picture is taken from my phone so forgive the quality. Was just easier and faster.  

Still on the Mate build, bluetoothctl says the Agent is restered and gives me the [bluetooth]#. And ""scan on"" shows everything except the Rii i8+.  

On the Raspbian side I get the following:

When I pull down the bluetooth menu and select Add Device it brings up a window that shows the Rii listed, but, for some reason it's [listed 3 times for some reason](http://imgur.com/a/0TV1dkQ
).  No matter which open you choose it always says [""pairing request sent to device - waiting for response...](http://imgur.com/a/h8sYZ7I). After about a minute, give or take a little, it gives me the following window that says [Pairing failed - Timeout was reached](http://imgur.com/a/tcHicmA).  It actually says this no matter which one you select.  

So that's that. I've been beating my head against the wall trying to figure this out for about a day or so and decided that a little bit of assistance would be beneficial.  I know there are probably some log files or commands that may assist you in helping me.  If there is anything that you would like me to run and then respond with the output please let me know.  

I greatly appreciate any help that you may be able to provide. And I cannot wait to find out what I am doing wrong or not doing at all.  Learn, learn, learn!!!! Thanks again!!!"

raspberry_pi,Problems with enabling wifi,"Enabling wifi

I’m trying to enable wifi on my pi 4. It’s connected via ethernet. Originally I set up the pi headless with wired connection. I have since tried setting up wifi both on the desktop environment and through command terminal.

I have changed wlan country to my country on desktop enviro, but every time I check it it seems to reset to country not selected. I have also tried though command line but it won’t allow me to select a country.

Under command interface, when I try to set the WLAN country it says @could not communicate with wpa supplicant” and then “there was an error running option L4 WLAN country”.

When I run is config:

eth0      no wireless extensions.

lo        no wireless extensions.


I have also opened the wpa-supplement config, which lists two networks, my home one and my mobile hotspot.

raspberry_pi,2020 Dec 7 Stickied 𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊 thread - Boot problems? Display problems? Networking problems? Need ideas? Get help with these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/k49sj3/2020_nov_30_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Even if your power supply claims to provide sufficient amperage, it may be mislabeled or the cable you're using to connect the power supply to the Pi may have too much resistance. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

-	I have attempted to add the printer via selecting the option under “local printers” and “discovered network printers”

I have installed CUPS on my 3B+ and I have gotten a .ppd file out of the Linux package that Canon offers on their site (though that package is not for ARM, it’s for i386/amd64 so I just extracted the package and found the .ppd files inside.)

I can go to the CUPS admin panel, see and add the printer without issue, selecting my .ppd file via the web interface.

When I try to print a test page from the CUPS admin interface it says the job was sent and then immediately refreshes to show the Jobs queue where the job shows a ‘State’ of ‘stopped’. Nothing has printed.

What am I missing? Thanks!"

raspberry_pi,"SSD Boot, pretty easy.","I've been wanting to do an SSD boot for a long time, today was the day I gave it a go.

As the RP4 power supply is only 5 amps and my supply of old SSDs was limited. My first choice was an OCZ 120GB SSD that is rated at 0.35 watts. Before I started I checked again and found that I also have a 120GB PNY SSD rated at 0.5W. Turns out that in benchmarks the PNY toasts the OCZ (which to be fair dates from 2011), so I plugged the PNY in with my StarTech USB3 to SATA adapter and all was well, so I used that.

I started out with this rather old guide...

* https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/boot-raspberry-pi-4-usb

It stopped working at step 7, so I used 'dd' to copy the microSD to the SSD. The transfer rate according to 'dd' was about 43 MB/s, not bad. Had I kept reading I would have noticed that Raspberian has a utility for that (SD Card Copier), but I don't see that it's really necessary, except for perhaps for those uncomfortable with disk destroyer.

Then I changed the boot options, powered down, unplugged the microUSB and rebooted, and here I am. The original boot took longer, the microUSB boot had to time out, but the process worked great.

Then I used Gparted to expand the filesystem to use the extra space. 

According to the article...

* In our real-life tests of a Raspberry Pi 4 with SSD last year we got impressive performance with sequential transfer rates as high as 140 MB / 208 MBps for reading and writing. 

The PNY did a lot better, especially with reads.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ dd if=/dev/zero of=iobw.tst bs=1M count=1000 status=progress  
1047527424 bytes (1.0 GB, 999 MiB) copied, 6 s, 175 MB/s  
1000+0 records in  
1000+0 records out  
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB, 1000 MiB) copied, 6.00755 s, 175 MB/s  
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ dd if=iobw.tst of=/dev/null bs=1M status=progress  
569376768 bytes (569 MB, 543 MiB) copied, 1 s, 569 MB/s  
1000+0 records in  
1000+0 records out  
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB, 1000 MiB) copied, 1.81654 s, 577 MB/s  
pi@raspberrypi:~ $  

Not bad, 577 MB/s reads.

I also have several 512GB and 1TB SSDs that I could use (left over after rebuilding the kids computers), but they draw from 1A to 1.5A and I'm not sure how much extra PS capacity the RP4 has or whether they would actually be faster with the RP4.

If there's anyone curious about SSD booting who has an extra SSD laying around and a USB3-SATA adapter, giver it a try. Please note that the RP foundation has only tested with a few USB3 to SATA adapters and the StarTech adapter is on the list.

Also, keep your original microUSB card around for a backup."

raspberry_pi,I Built an Ultra Minimal OS for Kubernetes,"👋 Hello. Wanted to share an achievement I am proud of with this community.

Almost four years ago I started working  on an ultra minimal OS for running Kubernetes. I started with nothing. Only a bare bones Linux kernel I built. The user space was written from scratch to provide just enough to run the kubelet.

Fast forward a few years, and I started a company around this idea. I shared it with the world and people loved it. One of the things I have always wanted was to get it on a Raspberry Pi. Now, nearly two years after starting the company (four years since I started the project), it is finally running on the RPi 4! 

I hope this community finds it useful. Enjoy!

How can you *really* know when your smart speaker is listening and sending data to the cloud? There have been documented cases in which up to a minute of speech has been transferred to the cloud without a wake-word having been spoken.

Speaker Snitch can give an absolute answer to this question by sniffing local network traffic and flashing a light sitting next to the speaker any time there is traffic between the speaker and the vendor's cloud service.

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 4B USB ports issue.,"I had a RPi 4B 2GB that I was using to watch youtube and movies.  It was working fine for 3 months but it started to have issues with USB ports, The mouse stops working.

I replaced it with a new R Pi 4B and stored it away.

Yesterday, the USB ports on my ""new"" RPi died.  The mouse won't work on this one too. I did restart the Pi and nothing.  USB ports won't work.

I was ready to order another one, but I decided to use it with any project that doesn't need a mouse or keyboard, so I brused off some dust and started to setup the Pi. Somehow, the USB ports were working again.

I thought it was a software issue, so I got the old Pi and tried with the SD and nothing.  USB port didn't work. I brushed off the dust from the old one and tried to use it and voilá, the USB ports were working again.

Apparently, using the Raspberry Pi 4B with a 5V fan, puts some dust on the board and it causes USB ports to fail.

In case you guys have trouble with your Raspberry Pi 4B USB ports, get a brush.   I never had this issue with any other R Pi models."

raspberry_pi,"1Wire and DS18B20, max_slave_count 64 reached","Hi, I have raspberry pi 3 model b with ProtoPi Plus Side for the breadboard.

When I was setting everything up on my desk 1Wire thermometers (on the breadboard) were working fine.

Then I moved everything to final location, one thermometer stayed on the breadboard and I connected 4 more on about 1.5m 4x0.5mm2 straight wire cable each and this is when the problems started as either there were 0 or a couple of the sensors at max.

When the breadboard sensor was the only one connected it worked fine. But as soon as I connected the other 4 it all started again. I shuffled connection a bunch of time and what I ended up is 0 sensors seen by rPi.

When I do `dmesg | grep w1` I get:

    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ dmesg | grep w1
    [    7.567798] w1_master_driver w1_bus_master1: w1_search: max_slave_count 64 reached, will continue next search.

    [   45.454338] w1_master_driver w1_bus_master1: Family 0 for 00.000000020000.07 is not registered.
    


When I do `ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/` I get:

    00-280400020000  00-c80400020000  w1_bus_master1



I tried to search what cable is best for 1Wire and found just a bunch of people saying they use cat5e.

[I found a post saying for 0-30 meters it's not critical, but safe to use cat5e](https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=84280#p84280) so I don't think it the cable fault.

Tomorrow I'll try connecting without the breadboard adapter or try another breadboard. I saw another post saying that cheaper breadboards could cause intermittent connection problems and mine costed 7.7PLN (about 2USD)."

raspberry_pi,Question related to touch screen calibration and Octodash,"Hi reddit,

first I wanted to say I am a total noob and just got my Pi for like 48 hours.

I bought the Pi for the purpose of Octoprint, and someone made a nice touch screen control for it called Octodash.

&amp;#x200B;

After a long research and fiddling, I managed to get them both installed and autoboot, with LCD functioning and touch screen registering touch.

The touch screen input however have swap axis, so i have run xinput\_calibrator and change 99-calibration.conf accordingly.

The problem is, OctoDash doesn't register my touch anymore (or freezed) after running xinput\_calibrator, not even if I restart the Pi.

The calibration was register as I can still run xinput\_calibrator and the outcome of the calibration is similar to what I had.

I have tried to reinstall Octodash but it still won't work.

I am at a lost in what I can try....... any input would b4e appreciated !"
raspberry_pi,Nightmare robotics project from hell- need advice.,"Hello reddit.
I have a nightmare robotics project. The project is supposed to be a group project, but It really is becoming more and more of a solo thing.
The project is for a high school robotics club. I am at a new school and am in 10th grade. Our school has a robotics elective which lets students work on the project in class for a  grade and elective credit.
The project is simple in concept. Input an audio signal through the USB port, and visualize the audio using RGB LEDs.
The characters:(not real names)

Me: 10th grade, STEM nerd, knows advanced math, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. Knows circuitry.

James: 10th grade. Claims to know calculus and trig. 

Greg: 12th grade. Learning how to be a machinist. Has “Leadership skills”, no tech skills.

Bryan: 12th grade. Likes planning stuff. Can fluently talk about things he knows nothing about and act like he knows it.

Mark: 10th grade. Class clown who doesn’t contribute to anything.

Kai: 11th grade. Allegedly did well in Basic Technical drawing and Engineering classes. Sits in corner juuling and watching anime.

Mr Jones: Teacher, Prototype engineer, and Builder.

After we get the RPi, I had to be out for a day. Bryan, Greg and Mr. Jones decide we are doing an audio visualizer behind my back.

All goes well during basic figuring out python, GPIO, Linux etc. Then the problems start:

Problem 1: James doesn’t know calculus or trig. He lied. This means the Fast Fourier Transform audio processing has to be done by me alone.

Problem 2: Chronic absences from Greg and Bryan. 

At this point, I realize If i do everything myself, then it can be finished by Jan 21(deadline).

Problem 3: Mr Jones’ Wants us to discuss for multiple days the differences between “Hard skills and Soft Skills” 

I can now *Barely* get it done, no time to spare.

Problem 4: Mr Jones wants me to delegate tasks. I have tried delegating in the past, nobody listens to be about anything and either goofs off or does nothing.

At this point, there are 14 class periods left. I schedule that if I get coding done by dec 17, I can get this done.

It looked promising, as i had got a program to control the LED matrix made. I was ahead of my crunch schedule!

Then there was last class.

Everyone decided to be annoying. Nobody wanted to help. Kai, James, and Bryan are coughing w/o masks on me to try to annoy me. Greg wanted to “Solder a broken chair back together” (Not kidding, Yes, really). I had to work in a room that smelled like burnt plastic with two people coughing and kai vaping. Galaxy brain Mr Jones chimes in with me needing to delegate to James. James doesn’t pay attention to coding instructions so i continue coding.
Mr Jones snaps and tells me HE is going to delegate tasks. He also tells me the project has to be done(no scaling back). He then says he has more RPiS(Never told me that).

I am in a Lose-Lose scenerio: Do all the work and get lots of points off for “soft skills”.

OR:

Delegate tasks and have to spend hours fixing code by people who can barely code, and lose points for an incomplete project.

What do I do?
What do I tell Mr. Jones?
How do I work with my team?
How do I not flunk the only class i wanted to take?
PMs welcome.
Thank you for your time."

raspberry_pi,Has the Raspberry Pi Foundation abandoned the Pi Zero at this point?,"The Pi Zero was introduced in 2015, and only got one minor update in 2017 (Pi Zero W). In that timeframe the regular Pi has seen 3 major redesigns (3B, 3B+, 4B), massively increasing RAM and CPU, and switching to USB C. In contrast, the Pi Zero still runs off two Micro USBs and 512MB, and the ancient armv6 architecture.

So, is the Pi Zero done for? I for one would love to see a USB C-based Pi zero (that can also be powered over the data port) with armv8 instructions. And I would think 1 or even 2GB of RAM shouldn't be out of the question either."

Now back to my discussion topic (or question). Is there, or why would it be technically impossible, to have a miniitx (or other standard) board that breaks out usb/hdmi/etc and use a CM4 as a SoC for the processor?

I do understand that it is a small market, no one thinks it is viable for making money and so on. But technically, would it not be possible to go to Gepetto or similar and design a mini itx board for the CM4 module?

I'm pretty sure it was a Pi project, but I guess it could've been Arduino."

so far so good. But when I connect it in the USB, i can't reach internet from my computer any longer, why? What makes it ""go bad""? is it some routing on my computer? where do I fix that? Is it some silly fact that pi is running DHCP and DNS server (pihole) that somehow takes over? Is it because it draws all the traffic? interestingly enough, if I ssh to pizero.local, it finds it's ipv6 address... I didn't prevented it, but never particularly set it up this way."

I have a raspberry pi model 4 and I also bought a camera for it and my idea is to make a mobile app for my personal use to watch my pet while I am not at home.

The problem is that I do not have a static IP therefore I cannot access the raspberry directly.

What options do I have?

My idea was to make something like the cameras that you can buy from aliexpress and access the stream from any part of the world via their mobile app. What technology is used in that type of scenario?

I guess its some broadcasting over cloud, but I was not able to find any solution.

If I have a 6S li ion battery (1400 mAh) powering 3 BLDC motors (24 V, 0.5 A continuous amp draw) for \~30 minutes, is it fine/safe to just put the regulator in parallel and have it power the RPi0W?  I'm not sure how that will affect the battery life span, will the power draw of the pi be negligible compared to that of the motors on the battery?  Any advice for using a PiSugar / independent battery or just hooking it up to the main battery but with a regulator?  I don't have much experience with the RPi specifically, so I don't know what to expect in terms of power draw if it is controlling 4 motor drivers (which are independently powered)."

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: What's a Raspberry Pi? What can I do with it?  
A: [Check out this great overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jzubxl/2020_nov_23_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/gdyq5qh/)
1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

I have to record 3-4 audio signals for a data science project. I have looked at something like [this sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063) to record the audio in a range of 20-20KHz. But I'd have to sample at 40kHz for that, right? So that would be 4 sensors \* 40'000 samples / second = 160'000 samples / second.  
I wasn't able to find out if that is correct and if the raspberry pi can even handle that.

Would a USB microphone be easier?  
I think I'd record for 1-2 seconds and then let my script run on the data to classify the audio."

raspberry_pi,Fried two keyboards?,"Been using my pi as a daily driver and decided to do a clean install of Arch (used a premade image earlier). And something went wrong. The boot did not work and stalled for diagnostic. My keyboard did not work, no light for capslock even. So I tried another apple keyboard, same issue. Tried another random keyboard, still no go. Tried with an external powered hub, all three keyboards and no go.

Thought it might be the sd card (even though I tried to reformat etc) and decided to try another image instead. It boots! But no USB at all. Tried the same as before and nothing works on usb. Tried with a cable for my phone and no charge available on any ports.

My conclusion is that the usb got fried somehow. I can also add that both of the apple keyboards are not working at all after I tried with the pi. The random keyboard works on a pc still.

Anything else to try before I contact the seller?"

I'm looking at using a few i2c devices hooked up to a 3B+ for a project, and I'm also planning on using an official 7"" screen for this project. I see that the screen uses the i2c pins for the touch inputs, and the docs for the screen mention using i2c to control the brightness of the screen, but I haven't found any actual information on how either of those work. Will using the touchscreen interfere with the i2c bus, or vice versa?

raspberry_pi,DIY netplay server for retroarch? Help please.,"So I’m trying to figure out how to make a custom game server for netplay on retroarch. I am making a retropie for my brother to send to him to play. We want to play over netplay but he is not very tech literate. Setting up a default client mode on his retropie would seem like the easiest as my ip only changes every month and it’s not too difficult to walk him through updating that. The problem with that is, is that makes him perpetually second player. As he is the older brother and Autistic(We both are) he has issue with this and it would deter him from playing with me. I don’t mind being second player, but in order for him to host, he needs to set up port forwarding on his router, which he doesn’t know how to do, and me walking him through the steps to do so would overwhelm the both of us. My idea for a solution would be to figure out a way to use a remote server I already pay for to host Django apps for testing, as a host server of sorts, that I can configure his pi to connect to during netplay, or that would allow him to be the virtual host and subsequently first player.   

My other idea for a solution was to figure out a way to put some sort of backdoor access on the pi (He gave me permission to do so if I can figure it out) before I send it to him, so that I can ssh into it and make the changes on his network for him remotely. I am not quite sure how to achieve this though without him already having port forwarding available. 

Any advice is appreciated."

raspberry_pi,Interphone system using pi,"Hello, I am planing an interphone system but I am quite inexperienced so I would love to see more experienced people opinions

&amp;#x200B;

My current idea:

2 numpad with station (to initiate the call)

2 reciever stations that will recieve the call if their code is inputed (may connect the station directly to already installed interphones but I have to research their protocols first and get an adapter in that case)

1 repeater station (maybe a wifi repeater can work here instead of an station)

&amp;#x200B;

The numpad station is conected to a door, when a code is inputed a voip call starts. To the reciever station of that code, a signal is also sent of what door is calling.

If during the call a button conected to the reciever station is pressed then it sends a signal to the numpad station to open the gate(the idea is to send this encrypted so it cannot just be copied).

If the button is presed while not on a call it does nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically my issues are:

1-I am not sure what pi would be the better fit for this project. I do not think the system is intensive on computation power but never worked with voip.

2-I am not sure if there are compatible ports for a rasp pi for a couple of old interphones I have laying arround so no idea if it would be better to just find new ones compatible with usb or something similar.

3-I have taken a look but didn't see open source similar systems, I have no issue making my own but I admit if someone has made it already they probably are better than what I can program by myself"

raspberry_pi,Question about automatically creating a ssh session to rpi0w,"Hello everyone,

I'm in the process of learning more about python, linux and networking protocols in general, and I was toying with the idea of automatically creating a ssh session to a rpi0w when it boots up.

Let me explain.

\- Assuming the ssh terminal and session should appear already authenticated on Computer A (Unix)

\- rpi0w (Computer B)  is configured to automatically connect to the wifi network

\- You don't really trust the network, even if it's a home network

How can I be prompted with an already authenticated ssh session on Computer A when the rpi0w is connected to a power source.

My take was to either:

\- Create a daemon or script on Computer A to try to constantly ping the static IP the rpi0w has, and if it's return is true then initiate the session (have the credentials stored in the script as plaintext ? - might be a security concern, right?)

\-  Have some sort of trusted key-escrow that stores the login info and have that as middle man

\- Create a CA and give both machines a certificate and have only that as the auth. mechanism (no info in plaintext)

\- Have the rpi0w give Computer A a heads-up that it's powered on, ready and somehow request a reverse shell (possible I've misunderstood what reverse shell means)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really open to suggestions or pointers where to look, the goal would be ultimately get up from my chair, plug the power cord in the rpi0w, and by the time I'm back at my desk a terminal session is already initiated.  

&amp;#x200B;

Really curious what I'm missing out as I have a high level view of the process but not really comfortable with implementing it.

4. Edit fstab to mount my drive on boot. [I used the instructions here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/external-storage.md).
5. Make bash script ([instructions here](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_wss0010.php)) that runs feh with the parameters I wanted, pointing to the folder on the mounted drive.
6. Edit the autostart file to run the bash script. [Instructions here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=263191).

**Gotchas:**

* I tried editing rc.local, .bashrc, init.d tab, systemd, *and* crontab as [instructed here](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/), but none of them seemed worked. The best I could do is have it run when the Terminal opened. So I tried to find a way to launch the Terminal on start. That was a dead-end. So I duck-duck-go'd and found a hidden gem (lost the link) that said crontab was the old way and pointed me to [the instructions in step 3 above](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=263191) that told me about autostart.
* I couldn't get autostart to run a straight Linux command, so I had to build a bash script.
* I couldn't get it to recognize the USB drive when it ran from autostart. I think the drive mounted after the autostart file ran. I only found this out because when I started in command line mode, the disk did not mount, so I had to figure out how to mount a drive through the command line.

**Next steps:**

* Have it turn off at night and back on in the morning
* Attach it to the back of the monitor and clean up the cords (see if I can find a really short HDMI cable somewhere)
* Probably not going to do but would be cool:
   * Figure out how to run it from the command line without a GUI
   * Build a wooden picture frame so it looks a little less like a monitor
   * Mount it on the wall instead of sitting on a table
   * Motion sensitive so it turns on in the middle of the night if mom wakes up and wanders in the room"

raspberry_pi,Ethernet Connection Speeds,"Hello! This is my first day having a Raspberry Pi, so I'm a total newbie. My main goal for my machine was to emulate basic GBA and SNES games, but at the core I wanted to use it as a Steam Link box.   


I have a perfect setup for this, or so I thought. My Pi is a Raspberry Pi 4B, and I have an ethernet cable running through a  TL-SG108 ethernet switch, connecting my Pi to the router, which is also connected to my host PC. I can't seem to get consistent ethernet speeds, but the most consistent thing that is happening is that the speeds don't seem to want to go above 100Mbps. It typically drops to about 30.  


I'm using a CAT6 cable that, when plugged into anything else, achieves full 1 GBPS or close to it on websites like [fast.com](https://fast.com), and other network benchmarking sites. Is there a configuration issue or something I can change in the software to make the gigabit port work properly?

&amp;#x200B;

As for things I've done as a result of research, I've tried installing various different networking utilities (to which, honestly, I'm not too sure what to do with. A lot of the commands that were recommended to use didn't come with further instructions attached to them.), I've tried connecting the Pi directly to the router to bypass the switch, I disabled Wi-Fi, unplugged USB devices, you name it. At this point I'm super stumped."

raspberry_pi,Sharing USB drive over a network to a Mac.,"Hello there.

I will preface this with saying that while I have a little bit of experience with Linux (mostly Ubuntu) and some command-line stuff, I’m pretty much out of my element here - mostly a Mac guy. However, I tend to pick things up pretty well when explained, so I figured I’d ask people who know more about this stuff than I do.

I purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 kit for a project, was able to boot to Raspian, change the password as recommended, get it updated, and even get the VNC server to access the desktop that way. Plugged in an HFS+ formatted drive and it popped up on the desktop.

However, that’s where the successes came to a halt. For the life of me, I can’t seem to get file sharing to work correctly.

I’ve tried following walkthroughs to getting SAMBA to work, and even found one to try and get AFP (apple’s file sharing) to function. It seems to work to an extent - I was able to connect to various Macs on my network and mount drives they have connected.

The problem is I need it to work the other way around; I need to be able to mount that drive on my Mac. I see it in on the network, but when I try and connect to it, it doesn’t recognize the username/password (pi/changed password) and won’t let me connect.

What am I missing and/or doing wrong?"

raspberry_pi,MotionEye-OS.....single purpose OS or some bells and whistles?,"I needed help evaluating MotionEye-OS for the Raspberry Pi 4 in a security cctv NVR application.  It's great that I see MotionEye is capable of recording IP cctv video to disk.  But, given that its' a very SMALL stripped down (~50MB) OS, does it have other OS like utility?  From what little i've seen on YouTube, when it boots up, it appears that  it is ONLY simply ready to run the attached camera.

My question is, is the ""OS"" more capable of the usual ""OS"" things:  (1) can i copy files from a HDD to a thumb drive via drag/drop, (2) can you run shell scripts, (3) is there a file browser, (4) will it playback video that's saved on disk for sample viewing etc, (5) can it host any other linux s/w apps besides the NVR function?

raspberry_pi,"""Quick booting""?? every 3 to 5 minutes","First: Im brand new. I had an arduino, but never a pi, so forgive my terminology.

So - not a full reboot, as if you unplug power and plug back in, and it will do like a 30 second startup. This is a 1 second boot. I have flightradar24's own image? file loaded onto it making it an ads-b reciever (with usb drive, antenna connected etc.) Viewing the hdmi output on my tv, it has a homescreen with a couple links. Ome is to view aircraft im currently tracking. I love viewing this screen. 3 to 5 minutes after having this open, it does a ""quick boot"" as i call it, with a whole screen of commands or executables, then take mes back to homescreen. That boot only lasts for 1 second. The pi emblems at top are never displayed, like in a real power boot up. Then i have to click the viewed aircraft link again, etc. Until another quick boot 3 to 5 min later. 

I bought this as a kit on amazon, and it came with a 2.5amp 5v power supply. In my research, number 1 problem with reboots is power supply. So i bought a 3amp 5v power supply. Same exact results. 

I have tried a 2nd microsd card, but it will not get me past the registration status of the receiever, i dont know why because it is tied to the mac of pi, so a 2nd card with exact same software image file should work... but whatever.

I have posted on the flightradar24 subreddit multiple times but have not gotten a single response, so this is a last ditch effort to post here. Hope this isnt annoying or aggrivating as i couldnt find anyone who had this same scenario as me in my researching."

raspberry_pi,[Tutorial] How to Run TensorFlow Lite Models on Raspberry Pi,"This tutorial covers how to use TensorFlow Lite on Raspberry Pi. The deep learning models created using TensorFlow typically require high processing capabilities to perform inference. Fortunately, there is a lite version of TensorFlow called TensorFlow Lite (TFLite for short) which allows such models to run on devices with limited capabilities. Raspberry Pi is also a fun and interesting use case to get hands-on experience with machine learning.

In this tutorial, we'll see how to prepare Raspberry Pi (RPi) to run a TFLite model for classifying images. After that, the TFLite version of the MobileNet model will be downloaded and used for making predictions on-device. Specifically, we'll cover:

* Accessing Raspberry Pi from PC
* Preparing TFLite in RPi
* Downloading MobileNet
* Classifying a Single Image

raspberry_pi,"First Pi Project Seinfeld (Simpson's) shuffler, Pi Zero","Hi,  


As the title says this is my first attempt at a raspberry pi project. I have very little programming knowledge and I have a couple specific questions.  
I am following the tutorial here:  [GitHub - tonybatts/simpsons-shuffler: A guide to a raspberry pi shuffler for tv shows](https://github.com/tonybatts/simpsons-shuffler)   
So far I have the Lite version of the os installed on the sd card.  But I realized, a little late, that this tutorial uses the Pi Zero W, mine does not have wifi.  

1) So my first basic question is do I need internet on the Pi it self? Can I skip activate Wifi step?  


2) On step 3, will I be able to install OMXplayer without internet?  


 

3) ""Change the directory to where the script will live ""cd /home/pi""' 

* How do I change the directory?

 

4)""Use an ftp program to ssh into your pi and find the Simpson file you just made.""  
 [SSH (Secure Shell) - Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md) 

 [SFTP - Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/sftp.md)   


 Kinda loops back to question 1, on the instructions it says step 1 to connect to internet.  Can I enable SSH without the Pi being connected to the internet?  


thank you"
raspberry_pi,There should be a RISC V Raspberry Pi,"Call it the Raspberry V as a play on it also being the 5th one or make it a variant like Raspberry Pi 5 Model VB, but I think that future Raspberry Pis should have a version based on a RISC V SoC or they should entirely switch to it. Here's why I think that would be great:

* RISC V is the hot ""new"" thing, it is more open and not owned by Nvidia, so in terms of the educational objective and the philosophy behind Raspberry Pi it seems like a great fit.
* RISC V SoCs might be(come) cheaper than ARM ones because there is no or less licensing involved.
* The software infrastructure and Linux support for RISC V are already very good and if there were a Pi with such an SoC it would give these efforts a great boost.
* The RPi foundation is already a member of the RISC V foundation.
* RISC V appears to be more elegant on paper.

And here's what probably wouldn't be that great about it or what needs to happen first:

* There don't appear to be (m?)any SoCs available with GPUs, so right now it would be embedded only or would need a customized core with a licensed or separate GPU. Especially the Pi 4 has focused a lot on becoming more Desktop-usable, so this is probably a must.
* It would probably be a major shift in terms of hard- and software with all the complexities involved.

raspberry_pi,"Pi Zero W - Not your typical ""My Wifi Isn't Working"" Post","My WiFi isn't working.

However, Bluetooth is working fine....

Background. Procured my Pi Zero W 1.1 a couple of years ago and configured an OTG mode for a mass storage device. Basically, the device was plugged into my Tesla and used as storage for the onboard ""Sentry"" cameras. Whenever the device would reconnect to my home WiFi (WiFI was working then), a number of scripts would fire to move the captured videos to a NAS and remove them from the Pi. This worked swimmingly for a number of months - until it didn't. Wifi just stopped. No device. No loaded modules. Nothing.

So I must have friend the Wifi chip somehow. OK - except Bluetooth continues to work just fine. I can power on, scan, pair, connect. No problems.

I've tried multiple SD cards. Multiple power supplies. Raspbian (Raspberry Pi OS) fresh installs. Headless wpa\_supplicant configs. Bare Arch install. None of it really matters if I can't get the kernel to see a WiFi device and load a module for it.

I'm stumped. I'm ready to accept defeat on the WiFi - if the stupid Bluetooth wasn't working! It's the same chip driving BT and WiFi, correct?

Insight appreciated. I'm able to SSH to the device configuring the USB port with a g\_ether OTG mode. Let me know what I can provide to assist troubleshooting."

raspberry_pi,"Making an ""automated curtain-raiser"", is this doable? :)","Hi, 

So here is the deal. Every day at 12 pm my robot vacuum cleaner(s) starts their round around the house. Now, the ""issue"" is a curtain over a doorway in the basement where the home-cinema is located. Due to forgetfulness and laziness, the curtain does almost never hung to the side when whoever is using the cinema room is done, meaning that the robot vacuum can't get past the curtain and vacuum the rest of the basement.

So I was thinking (mostly because it seems more fun than anything else) if I coded a raspberry pi to raise the curtain 30 cm every day at 12 pm, then at 1 pm lower it back down. 

Now, I am not really sure how to go about this project, the coding part of it I can do without any help, but the hardware? Not so much. So since the curtain is just a regular curtain without any strings to raise it from before I figured I would need to sew a ""stick"" in the bottom of the curtain to make it ""solid"" at the bottom (if that makes any sense). And then I would need to somehow find a ""rope"" that I can use an engine to pull the curtain up.

Most likely that made very little sense to anyone reading this so here are some (bad) pictures, but I think they will paint a better picture:

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jvij0a/2020_nov_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=flair%3Atutorial+OR+flair%3Ashow-and-tell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Arcade bonnet - help with keycodes?,"I'm working on getting an Adafruit arcade bonnet and joystick to work on my pi. After all the soldering I'm supposed to just edit a file to take the joystick as input rather than the keyboard but I can't understand this keycodes thing. I've tried looking this up for weeks and can't find a direct answer or even hint at what I'm missing. 

[Arcade Bonnet instructions I'm following](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arcade-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/software)

This may be incredibly simple but the only instructions I can find just say to ""edit the file"". I went to the input.h file but it's not a list (to my amateur eye) of what to put or specifically what to edit. I just want the 4-way joystick to be the directional input.

Any help whatsoever would be amazing. This project is at a standstill until I can figure this part out. Thank you."

I'm looking at a solution where I have a RPi with Raspbian on it to gather data with and then I want it to automatically connect to a MQTT broker I have set up on my wifi when I get back home, to make pushing the data gathered easier. I cannot seem to find anything about function calls on wifi connection and so on, there are ways to control the wifi connection in general, but I'd prefer to use Raspbians built in wifi solution. Ideally there'd be a function call when the RPi connects to wifi x that then automatically connects the RPi to the MQTT broker in python. Any advice/ideas?

Since last night, I was trying desperately to make the raspberry display on the small monitor. 

It finally displayed and booted but on the large smart TV screen in the livong-room. 

For some unknown reasons, it does not display on the small monitor but it does on the large smart TV. 

I might buy a new monitor to display raspberry.

raspberry_pi,Questions for those of you who use Raspberry Pi as a plex server?," Hi thinking about getting a raspberry pi 4 4gb for a plex setup (local only) and had a few q's.

1. How many simultaneous streams assuming direct playing them all?
2. Will it be okay for 1080p and 4k remux files (direct play, assuming bandwidth is not an issue)?
3. Can the pi transcode audio streams?
4. What are the temps on the device like, can you leave it on 24/7?
5. Do you need a case/cooling fan?
6. What storage do you use/recommend preferably something quite, looking to get something to get me off the ground so like 6-8tb? (6-8tb would get me a 200+ of my ripped blu rays so I don't mind this kind of storage where I can dump a number of movies from my collection watch them and then delete and replace with other ones every so often).
7. Could I literally just buy a 8tb external plug it in the mains and then plug it in via usb? Do I need special drives to be left on 24/7?

I don't really want to get plex pass if that makes any difference.

Anything else I should know then please do let me know!"

For  this communication to succeed, no interruptions are allowed, because otherwise the time window for data to be transmitted or received would  be missed. However, doesn't Linux exactly do that? Interrupt a process  and perform a context switch to run the next process? If for some reason  this doesn't happen in the case I described, why not and why doesn't  the desktop appear frozen?

Also, how can we guarantee that a peer will write/read data exactly  when the clock signal goes high or low? What if the peer is doing  something else other than monitoring the clock when it changes? Even in  Arduino, how is any data through Serial saved in a buffer somewhere  while the Arduino might be doing something else?"

raspberry_pi,Impressions on the current 64-bit Raspbian beta,"Well, I went and bought a Raspberry Pi 4 model B, 8GB with a heatsink case.  It may even become more job-relevant for what I do (medical device and software testing).  Since it has a 64-bit CPU, I looked for and installed a 64-bit Raspbian OS...to my chagrin, the only one I found was a beta version, but I'm an old hand at OS betas from the pre-MacOSX days, and even a few of the Mac OSX beta versions (took me a while to find out the kernel panic that kept me from using it was from my capture board...ugh).  Unfortunately, owing to compatibility issues, I had to go back to the 32-bit version, but here's what I have found...

It has a lot of promise, and it works with almost all of the software I put on it.  I say ""almost"" because I'm building my Pi4 into self-contained portable dev kit chassis. 

Before anyone says ""Pi 400,"" I can see the utility of such a device, but I'm trying to come up with a modular form-factor and standards set for an open-source development-capable laptop. The Pi400 has 4GB RAM, half of what I have, and the Pi400 requires that the user obtain a mouse and a screen...it also precludes the use of the display and camera ports.  The form factor will also allow for upgrades to the main module.

Back to the topic at hand...the OS does work as expected.  Quake runs smooth as silk, GIMP runs just fine.  However, it does have a few issues when I use the Arduino IDE.  During tests, I was able to program an Arduino Uno and an Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 without problems.  However, trying to download the board software for other Adafruit boards returned an error: ""tool bossac is not available for your operating system."" I ran a search, bossac was installed.  But it hints at a few fundamental bugs.

Bottom line...I wouldn't install it quite yet unless you want to torture-test it and give feedback to the devs, but the performance suggests that we're looking at a solid OS once they work the kinks out."

raspberry_pi,How to spin down idle harddrives?,"Hi!

I have a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspbian Buster. I'm running the full desktop version, but the Pi will mainly be used headless.

I've auto-mounted an external harddrive through *fstab*.

Previously, while running Stretch on a Pi 2 without GUI installed, the harddrive would spin down on idle after about 30 minutes, which is handled by the harddrive itself (WD My Book 3TB).

Now though, since I've set up Raspbian to boot and log into Raspbian OS automatically, the harddrive never spins down on idle. I've confirmed that the expected behavior (30 minutes spin down) occurs if I disable auto-login to GUI.

I've tried to install *hdparm* with the following setup for */etc/hdparm.conf*:

    /dev/disk/by-uuid/[hdd_UUID] {
        write_cache = on
        spindown_time = 180
    }

In the GUI, I've also disabled auto-mounting with the default file manager.

However, these steps doesn't work (note that *hdparm* wasn't necessary before, since the hard drive took care of idling down itself). The only thing that works, is to disable auto-login to GUI. That's a bummer, because I was planning to attach a remote keyboard/mouse and be able to use the Pi 4 as sort of a media server attached to my TV (I've successfully overclocked the Pi to the max).

And of course, there is no activity to the drive. The only activity is either backups running on cron jobs, or me accessing the files I have on there. The rest of the time the drive should be on idle.

If it's interesting at all, here's the */etc/fstab* entry for the disk in question

    UUID=[hdd_UUID]  [mount_pos]  auto  defaults,uid=[my_user],nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=3,fmask=111  0  0"

 [https://raspberrytips.com/install-pi-hole-ad-blocker/](https://raspberrytips.com/install-pi-hole-ad-blocker/) 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first project and I'm trying to install a Pi-hole. I've always been intrigued by the Pi but couldn't think of a use for it until I found this.

Specs - I am using a Pi4 with 4gb ram and a 32 gb SD card running PiOS. I know this is overkill for a Pi-hole but my thoughts were once I figure it out I can duplicate it a smaller Pi and have this one to play with. So here I am. I set up the pi using NOOBS the first time to make sure everything worked and then using a 2nd card set it up following the tutorials I found.

My issue is and I've  followed a few tutorials all supposedly ""easy"" but most seem to gloss over some of the details and In my view skip a lot of steps at least from a beginners point of view.

Anyway I've gotten to the point the Pi and Pihole are set up but the issue I'm having is setting up the router properly to have the pi be the interface  (DNS Server if my terminology is correct) and actually get the pi hole and do its job.

Using this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXUCgQDGODQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXUCgQDGODQ) I get to the about the 7:40 mark and then get lost.

I think the this just may be a limitation on the router or a Century Link thing and a combination of me not interpreting what I'm seeing being actually what I need.

The first thing is I can't seem to assign the Pi a static address but going into DHCP reservation and having the Pi's mac address it appears I've reserved a singular address for the pi and its stays.

What I'm getting lost on is how to configure the router to point everything through the Pi and honestly I'm afraid of changing something and killing the router and having nothing work.

I have searched the google/youtube specifically trying to find more information on how this particular router works and have gone through all the settings pages that I have access to but nothing seems to match what I'm being shown.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help pointing me in the right direction would be helpful. I'm a good 10 hours + into what appeared to be a 1/2 to an 1 hour project lol. Thanks"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 8mm Film Telecine,"Hi all!

So a while back I mentioned I was making a film scanner (telecine) for my final year university project. I then promised once it was all done I would post about it here so here we go!

To make this easy, [my full dissertation is available here](http://www.chris-cunningham.co.uk/uni/2020/raspberry-pi-film-telecine-university-dissertation), do keep in mind it's 140 pages converted over to my website and there is a pdf link at the top if you don't fancy scrolling now!

Couple of quick points:

1. This is not the ""best"" version of this you can get. I specifically made this harder on myself keeping the build to below £150 including all parts (Raspberry Pi and all!). 
2. I doubt I'll be revisiting this any time soon, only as there's only so far I could personally go with no formal teaching in electronics and python coding, yet I hope this serves as a nice baseline for inspiration for future builds for those who wish to do so.
3. I completed the build and testing during lockdown here in the UK back in April/May... so some testing was unable to be completed due to completing the project and this write-up during lockdown.

Finally, I just want to say it did all work out! I received a First Class with Honours in Video Production and Streaming BSc and for this project I have received an IET Education Award. 

So yeah, lot of work but a lot of fun!

raspberry_pi,Waterproofing cable connectors with Blu Tack or something similar (subzero temperatures),"I've got a Raspberry Pi + camera in an enclosure that will be outside and occasionally exposed to subzero temperatures, possibly as low as -40 in really bad weather.

I've waterproofed most of the components with a flowable silicone, but I would like something less permanent for the cable connections, so I can easily disconnect everything if there's a problem.

I've been considering poster putties like Blu Tack, but I'm not sure if they hold up outdoors, in cold and wet environments.  Another option is something like Sugru I guess, which would handle the weather conditions better, but could be difficult to remove.

Anybody have any other suggestions?  I really like the idea of a putty that I could just squish onto the cable connections to get a somewhat waterproof seal, but also remove later.

Thank you!

raspberry_pi,Pi 400 keyboard stopped working properly,"Hi, I've recently bought the new Pi 400. For a couple of days everything was working just fine, but now something has broken down. I've experienced some random keystrokes when typing and some of the keys stopped working at all. I reflashed the OS several times but nothing has changed, expect for the 'errors' being constant now. The backspace key works only after holding it down for \~2s, same with '\[', which seems to be mapped as backspace as well. Moreover, some keys seem to have double input, for example the '\\' key sends ':|' at the same time.

Is it some issue with drivers and can I 'hard reset' them or is my Pi faulty?

P.S. The issue is the same in Raspbian and in Ubuntu, if I connect a bluetooth keyboard it works perfectly fine."

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that came from ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

The VX1000 is the ultimate camera for skateboarding videography. The sound, the color, the aesthetics, is all perfect for capturing skating— except the camera is from the 90’s and records to now mostly defunct DV tapes. 

However, there is an equally ancient workaround for tapeless recording. It’s very expensive, records to compact flash, and looks like this: 
 https://youtu.be/biAT2WO573Q

I’ve just started thinking about building something better: ideally it takes signal either from the camera’s FireWire or RCA out, it’s captured via some sort of capture card, routed through a computer (?) and gets saved onto an SSD or SD card or something. Itd have to be portable and all mountable onto the camera to make it worthwhile... is this something a Raspberry Pi could help me achieve? 

Is it as simple as writing something that just takes the captured video off the card and puts it onto the SSD? Am I missing something?

I don’t know how to write code, or even copy paste stuff that already exists into this project, but if somebody could at least tell me it’s possible or what I would really need to make it possible, I would jump in and start learning for myself. Just gotta know where to look. 

Thanks!"

I am trying to have a Pi 3 Model B+ create a WiFi network that I can connect to with my phone so I can SSH in without Internet and run what I need to. I don't want to use Ethernet or USB tethering. To be clear, I'm not trying to make a bridge to another network. I just want it to make a local network that I can connect to. I would love to be able to do the setup headless, but if I have to plug in a monitor for the initial setup, that's fine. I have tried a few solutions online, and most of those seemed to either be setting up an ad-hoc network, which I don't think is quite what I'm going for, as that seems to be for intercommunication between identical or similar devices, or using it as an access point for an existing network.

Anyway, I hope you all understand what I'm going for, and thanks in advance!"

raspberry_pi,How to turn a Pi into a crypto trading bot with no extra hardware and open-source software!,"This is what you'll need for this cool Pi project:

* Raspberry Pi 2GB RAM ($40). If you plan to run long (multi-year) backtests you will likely need the 4GB or 8GB version (2 GB is enough for shorter backtests and trading live).
* Flash-card, 16Gb ($7).
* Raspbian / Ubuntu ($0, open-source).
* Node.JS ($0, open-source).
* Git ($0, open-source).
* Superalgos (0$, open-source).

I'll assume your Raspberry is fully set up with Raspbian or Ubuntu. If it's not, just follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Let's get on with the rest of the software set up:

1. Download and install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Download and install [Superalgos](https://superalgos.org/download.shtml).

You don't want to run the Superalgos GUI on your Raspberry… the 2GB RAM version won't be able to cope with it.

**The clever setup is to use the Pi as a backend service that you access from your regular machine's browser.**

So, run Superalgos with the `noBrowser` option. If your Pi is less than 8GB RAM, then add `minMemo` too:

`node run minMemo noBrowser`

The command will start Superalgos backend servers on your Pi!

Then, open Chrome on your regular machine to access the Superalgos backend web server. You will go to the Raspberry's IP address on port 34248. Like this:

`http://RaspberryIPNumber:34248/`

Once in, click Stop on the Welcome tutorial, right-click to open the design space map, and click on the Network hierarchy. Expand the hierarchy (plus button on the menu) and find the Network Node.

&amp;#x200B;

[Remember to right-click to access the design space!](https://i.redd.it/ol278xar07z51.gif)

Now, access the configuration of the Network Node (select Configure on the menu) and change the host by typing your Raspberry's IP address:

`{`

`""host"": ""RaspberryIPNumber"",`

`""webPort"": ""34248"",`

`""webSocketsPort"": ""18041""`

`}`

Exit the configuration by withdrawing the mouse pointer from the configuration bubble. The GIU will auto-connect in less than a minute, and you are ready to go!

If you are not familiar with Superalgos, then right-click to open the design space map again, and click on the Welcome tutorial hierarchy on the bottom-left corner, open the menu, and click Resume.

The tutorial will take you through all the basics and help you run your first data-mining operation, your first backtest using a demo trading system, and even your first live trading session on Binance.

Once you go through the first experience, you may learn to design your own strategies or use the ones shared by the Community.

&amp;#x200B;

[This is how designing a strategy looks like!](https://i.redd.it/xzmnx8gy07z51.gif)

**The set up you just created is the minimum expression of a** [**trading farm**](https://docs.superalgos.org/suite-fundamental-trading-farms-concepts.html)**. If you have more Raspberries, or even old laptops or desktops gathering dust in the closet, pull them out, and set them up as new nodes on the Network!**

A trading farm setup may run distributed and coordinated tasks across multiple machines, and each machine may run as many trading sessions as the hardware can cope with!"
raspberry_pi,Is Ubuntu worth on a Pi3? Or Arch?,"Hi, just a quick question: I use mainly my Pi3 as Pi-Hole and OpenVPN server, I have installed Raspbian and I'm overall very satisfied with it.

I personally will not be buying from a company that is misleading this community and using predatory sales practices. This isn't simply a 3rd party reseller.

raspberry_pi,"RPi4 and VSync, can't stop screen tearing","Hi! I hope that someone over here can help me out with this issue as I'm out of ideas.

I have RPi4B+, 8GB of RAM, 16GB microSD, RaspberryOS Lite (Debian Buster, only CLI); FullHD 60Hz display via HDMI.  
Forced turbo in config.txt, no overclocking, enabled G2 FKMS driver, disabled composer.

Installed openFrameworks and created basic example app with some blue lines going side to side. Getting stable 60fps, no temperature issues (50-55 Celsius max), no voltage warnings, CPU usage at 20%.

What's the issue? I have constant screen tearing. Mostly by the edge of the screen, but it can also jump to the middle of screen. It looks like there's no VSync at all. openFrameworks enables it by default, but just to be sure I'm also calling it in my offApp::setup() with

    ofSetVerticalSync(true);

I looked around and the only solution that I found was to disable composer in raspi-config. I did it, no change.

Not sure what to try next...

raspberry_pi,My Pi doesn't like my Netgear unmanaged switch anymore,"So I've had this Pi setup for like 6 months with Pihole working great.  it's been hooked up to my Netgear unmanaged switch, which also has two other things hooked up.  Out of nowhere one day, the Pi just died and everything on it's DNS stopped working until i went back to auto DNS.  I couldn't figure it out!  So today i'm flashing dietpi as I figured it got corrupt somehow.  Well upon initial boot, it kept getting network failure, no matter what I did.  It was plugged into this Netgear unmanaged switch, which again, has other things plugged in that all work fine.  So i'm confused, i reboot router, switch, change cables, do everything..then i'm like, ok let's plug it right into my Nighthawk router.  Did that, and bam, it stopped failing network connection on first boot, and now it's updating.....so WTF?  nothing changed on my network, router, or anything at all.  Why would my Pi not work on this little switch anymore?

I've done some searching, and it isn't obvious how to get this to work.  Maybe some device that hooks up to USB?

raspberry_pi,2020 Nov 9 Stickied 𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊 thread - Boot problems? Display problems? Networking problems? Need ideas? Get help with these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/jmyl6b/2020_nov_2_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot_problems/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi Zero GPIO Pins not working?,"As a disclaimer, I'm new to digital electronics and somewhat new to soldering.

I recently bought a standard GPIO header for my raspberry pi zero, but in order to use both the camera part of my case and the pins, I soldered the pins up from underneath, rather than from above down. So the short pins are soldered on the top of the board instead of underneath like usual. However, I tried using a screen module on this, which only showed up black but shows up in full display on the other pi zero I soldered in the traditional way. My T cobbler also works on the normal one, but not on the one soldered upside down.

What could be the possible cause for this? I tried reversing the orientation of the ribbon cable from the Pi to the T Cobbler and that showed power for a brief second before dying off.

Again, I'm extremely new to this sort of thing since my specialty is programming, so I'm not sure how to diagnose these sorts of issues -- I do have a multimeter, as well if need be."

raspberry_pi,e-Paper is not working,"Hi all,
I am a complete newbie to the raspberry Pi community and also to python. At the moment i am trying to set up my Waveshare 1.54in ePaper display, but I can’t even get the democode to work. I have tried multiple guides to set everything up. I can’t get it done. I’m afraid I did something wrong, but don’t know what. As the mentioned complete newbie, I am pretty stranded here and don’t know what to do next. 

What have I done so far:

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2 flashed SD Card with the newest version of Raspian which I got from the official Raspberrypi website. Updated everything via the first window, which guides you through the first initial setup.

1.54in Waveshare ePaper Display (the V2 Version, this matters, as far as I know) connected directly to the pins on the Pi as shown in the official instructions by Waveshare.

Installed the needed library’s and so on, also like described in the instructions by Waveshare.

When I run the Democode (epd_1in54_V2_test.py), nothing happens, the ePaper is staying blank (white).
I get some Debug info looking something like this:

INFO:root:epd1in54_V2 Demo
INFO:root:unit and Clear
DEBUG:root:e-paper busy
DEBUG:root:e-paper busy release
.

raspberry_pi,My (early) thoughts on the Raspberry Pi 400,"Hello - I've been playing with my Raspberry Pi 400 over the weekend and wanted to share my thoughts on it so far - I'm currently running Ubuntu MATE 20.10 on it and am writing this from it.

**Background**
I have owned the Pi 1, 2 and 3 and was on the fence about getting a 4, but when I saw that the 400 was announced, I ordered one straight away from Pimoroni in the UK. It arrived on Friday and I have been using it for most of the weekend - I wanted to share the good and bad points of the experience so far.

**Good points**
* Build quality - it is built extremely well and feels very solid (possibly due to the heatsink). There is no keyboard flex either, and the plastics feel better than what you would expect from a £65 computer.
* Speed - Obviously, due to the extra RAM and faster CPU/GPU, it feels much faster than any of the other Pis I have used before, and it can genuinely be used for a lot of day to day tasks (such as writing this Reddit post)!
* Temperatures - it runs very cool - even when playing 4K video or when using demanding websites, the CPU temperature has never gone above 65 degrees Celsius.
* Hardware power switch - this is definitely a big bonus to the 400, and it does make it easier to ""pick up"" and use.

**Meh points**
* Software support *(probably only temporarily)* - as the 400 is so new, a lot of Linux distros haven't had time to catch up with the 400 hardware, so there are some weird issues, apparently due to slight firmware differences. Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu 20.10 work very well though in my experience so far.

**Bad points**
* Keyboard - I am not sure whether I may have a slightly defective unit, but I am getting a lot of double keypresses - this may be due to the way I type though, as I am pretty heavy handed.
* Lack of a headphone jack - this is the most disappointing thing in my opinion about the 400, especially as the RPi 4 has one, and while HDMI audio out works well, I think a headphone jack would have been a great addition, especially with the RPi Foundation targeting this as a device for online schooling.

Overall, though, this is probably the best value computer I have ever owned and it has surprised me with how impressive it is for the price - it almost makes me feel nostalgic for the times I started tinkering with Linux back in 2008 on an Asus Eee PC netbook. If anyone wants to ask me anything about the 400, please go ahead!"

raspberry_pi,Autotype/macros for Linux CLI,"Hi!

For quite a while now I'm using different Linux shells on various distributions, like Synology NAS, Raspberry Pis or on a firewall e.g. IPfire. 

I've been using tools like Putty, MobaXterm, ZOC from Emtec, Xshell from Netsarang or simply the new Windows Terminal. Some of them have macro support others do not support. 

E.g. I've about 60 macros in MobaXterm but ordering them or tagging or sorting into folders, mabe profile based, is limited or does not exist at all. 

So do you know of any tool that performs autotyping commands into the various shells, preferable the new Windows Terminal. 

I already had a quick look into Autohotkey but this one is a bit oversized and IMO too complicated to set up.

raspberry_pi,Question: Compile C++ binaries on raspi,"Hey everyone,  
I am trying to compile Rosetta (a bio molecular software written in C++) on my raspberry pi. As a fun project I try to do some protein structure determination.  
It works totally fine with Scons on my intel processor on Arch Linux, however it seems the compile settings are not compatible with ARM processors on raspberry pi.  
I get the following error:  


    KeyError: ""Processor 'armv7l' with machine designation 'armv7l' is unsupported.""

Do you know how to alter the compile settings so I can compile the binaries on the raspberry pi?  
Thank you in advance!"

I know my pi 400 is fine because I have another SD with retropie and it works perfectly on both the pi 4 and the pi 400."

Is there a more cost effective way to get this done? I've dibbled with intro python so far but in terms of LED not really. Only the intro and single/ double LEDs with resistors and no external power supply needed. 

So is this a feasible project? Im asking here as I realised the potential for this kind of project using a raspberry pi or a microcontroller."

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely/crashing, ethernet/wifi stops working, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).
21. Q: I'm running my Pi with no monitor connected, how can I use VNC?  
A: First, do you *really* need a remote GUI? Try using ssh instead. If you're sure you want to access the GUI remotely then ssh in, type `vncserver -depth 24 -geometry 1920x1080` and see what port it prints such as `:1`, `:2`, etc. Now connect your client to that.

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

Pikaraoke is a ""KTV style"" karaoke machine. It connects to your TV, and shows a QR code for mobile devices to connect to a web interface. From there, you can seamlessly search your local track library, queue up songs, add new tracks from YouTube, and more! The pandemic is maybe not the best time to have a karaoke party, but solo / quarantine pod karaoke might keep the blues away.

Would love to hear feedback from more folks and get some contributions to the project. Thanks!

I thought it would be cool to design a case out of pieces from two old lego Minecraft sets. I wanted to design the case to be music-related so the spaceman at the top is using a turntable. There is also a rotary encoder for volume control. I was going to use the music box service but could not get the rotary encoder volume knob to work for it. Picking up some wired desktop speakers soon for it. The USB stick is for loading MP3 files on to it. thinking of also possibly getting the 7-inch touchscreen for my family members to easily interface with it without much confusion. Feel free to post suggestions for my project in the comments section!

It seem that it is commonly accepted that there is quite a performance gap between rasp booted on USB rather than on the SD cards.

But is this will still be true if there is other application using (intensly) the USB ? The applications I have in mind are Nextcloud and Kodi.

I have 3 setup in mind : 

1. Boot on SD card, App data on SSD via USB.
2. Boot on a SSD disk, App data on another.
3. Boot and App data on the same SSD.

is the concurrent access, between app and os, to the SSD data will make the boot USB useless ?

As the USB controler are unique, is there going to be a performance gap between the setup 2 and 3 ?

raspberry_pi,serial connection from raspberry pi to Arduino,"Hey everyone, 

I tried sending data from raspberry pi 4 to a Arduino Nano via a 433 MHz modul. My idea was, to directly connect this to the serial port of the pi, which is port 8, according to this page [https://de.pinout.xyz/pinout/pin8\_gpio14](https://de.pinout.xyz/pinout/pin8_gpio14)

Since I didn't get any results I tried connecting the rx and tx port of the pi directly together and executed following code:

    import serial
    
    b = b'\xa8'
    
    ser = serial.Serial(""/dev/ttyS0"", 9600, timeout=1)
    ser.readall()
    print(""1"")
    ser.write(b)
    print(""2"")
    ser.readall()
    print(""3"")

I thought it should print 

&gt;1  
&gt;  
&gt;2  
&gt;  
&gt;b'xa8'  
&gt;  
&gt;3

but I only got

&gt;1

The program didn't stop or anything, it's still running after that 1, but doesn't do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Can it be, that my ssh connection is block the serial port, or do I have to configure anything to get it working? I have really no more idea.

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks in advance!"

raspberry_pi,How to connect components to gpio over a small distance?,"Hi all,

I'm working on a project, and my limited electrical experience has me a little stuck. Basically, I need to have the pi in the center of a space and connect several small motors (very small, can easily be powered by 3.3v) to GPIO for control. The furthest out of the small motors will be something like three feet away, so I think I'm okay for voltage drop. This might seem like a silly question, but what do I actually use to connect the components to GPIO? None of the GPIO cables I see online are longer than half a foot. Do I need to make my own by attaching connectors to raw cable, or is there some much easier way I'm missing? Also, minimizing bulk on the motor end is a major concern for the project, so putting additional components on that end is kind of out of the question unless they're very small.

Thanks!"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi should support an external wifi/bluetooth antenna,"This is a bit of an opinion piece but I wanted to complain a little about them not adding a jack on the board for an external antenna especially on the Pi 4.

The Pi is at the point now where it definitely needs a case or large heatsink to dissipate enough heat to not thermal throttle. Which means that it's often going to be wrapped in a big block of metal.

What would be amazing would be if they'd have put a connector on the board for an external antenna. We'd be seeing cases that included antennas and leaving holes in the case to get to the connector or cases that integrated an antenna onto the top and connected entirely internally to the Pi.

Right now once you put a Pi in one of the more popular cases, it'll always be taking a bit out of your wireless performance. It's silly to buy a USB dongle just so that your bluetooth adapter isn't sitting in it's own personal faraday cage."

- Décembre 2020 : Je mets le montant de mon impôt estimé sur un PER. 
- Janvier 2021 : Fin des droits au chômage, je casse le PER et je récupére le capital de mon PER défiscalisé. 
- Mai 2021 : Je déclare mon investissement en PER de décembre 2020 et réduit mon impôt de 11 %.

Est ce que je me trompe ou pas ?"

raspberry_pi,Bat computer Diorama,"Hi I'm new to Raspberry PI and Python, but I'm making some headway on my project, but I could use some help to get me the rest of the way.

 My idea is to have a display that loops a video,  but when you press a GPIO button it plays a different video. If the new video is playing and another button is pressed it stops the current video and plays the new video. After the video you pressed the button for ends, it will automatically go back to the original looped video that started on start up.

This is going to be a display for a Batcomputer in a Batcave Diorama I'm building. The trophy room will have various weapons from the villains in glass/plastic displays. Each will have a GPIO button near the bottom, and when pressed the led light at the top will go from 50% to 100% and will play a video about their origins on the Batcomputer screen.

 Here is my current code:

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  
 import os  
 import time  
 

ledPin = 23  
 

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)  
 GPIO.setup(17,[GPIO.IN](http://gpio.in/), pull\_up\_down=GPIO.PUD\_UP)  
 GPIO.setup(18,[GPIO.IN](http://gpio.in/), pull\_up\_down=GPIO.PUD\_UP)  
 GPIO.setup(ledPin,GPIO.OUT)  
 

os.system('xterm -e omxplayer -o -loop hdmi Desktop.mp4 &amp;') # the video that starts on loop...This Works  
 

try:  
while True:  
 

input\_state = GPIO.input(18)  
input\_state1 = GPIO.input(17)

  
if  input\_state == False: #if button 1 is pressed, stop video and start  new one... This works

  
os.system('killall omxplayer') #stops omxplayer  
os.system('killall xterm') #stops external   
print('Button 18 Pressed')  
\#GPIO.output(ledPin, GPIO.HIGH) #going to have a led turn on too at some point

  
os.system('xterm -e omxplayer -o hdmi Bio\_JOKER.mp4 &amp;') #plays video externally so you can end the video by pressing q or crtl + C or by pressing the other Gpio Button  
time.sleep(.3)  
 

if  input\_state1 == False: #same functions as above

  
os.system('killall omxplayer')  
os.system('killall xterm')  
print('Button 17 Pressed')  
\#GPIO.output(ledPin, GPIO.HIGH)  
os.system('xterm -e omxplayer -o hdmi Scarecrow.mp4 &amp;')  
time.sleep(.3)  
 

if input\_state == True: #this does not work...I want it to play the original video up top on loop This plays it again but a million times on top of it's self and will not let you out of the videos.   
os.system('xterm -e omxplayer -o -loop hdmi Desktop.mp4 &amp;')  
 

except KeyboardInterrupt:# when keyboard interupt(Press control+C while in shell) happens it is going to stop the while loop and end the porgram.  
os.system(""killall omxplayer"")  
os.system('killall xterm')

raspberry_pi,Looking ahead to Halloween 2021: How do I split one video from one HDMI out so that each half displays on two different screens?,"We have two dormer windows on the top story of our house.

Those clings are getting old and I'll need to replace them next year. But I got to thinking: I could put two cheap LED TVs up there and have video of ""live"" eyes doing their thing.

https://youtu.be/XrIEa0aSM7c?t=35

To keep the eyes synchronized, it seems it'd be easiest to play a single video on, say, a Raspberry Pi but split the video down the middle so that one eye plays in the right window and the other eye plays in the left.

I've got the concept, but I'm not sure how to tackle it, though. How do I split one video from one HDMI out so that each half displays on two different screens?

5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Any advice is appreciated. 

Also anyone who has  experience with this project I would appreciate your take. Folks online swear it makes a world of difference on audio reproduction. Hifiberry says it voids the warranty and is a waste of time as the Digi pulls clean power from the Rpi. 

The other areas with 4 vias is for a BNC connector.  I wonder if I need to solder all four pins? 2 large pins seem to be just for stability. Doing all four just in case.

I have a laptop issued by my employer, it's so choked down with their management and surveillance software that is basically unusable. My company contacts through a third party IT administrator and they're completely useless to try to talk to. My only supervisor says he doesn't care what I use to get my work done,  only that it gets done. 


 I do very little on this computer ie checking email,  editing Word documents,  pdfs very infrequently,  maybe a power point once in a blue moon. Even with such mild usage it preforms terribly.  


Once upon a time my main home computer crashed and I replaced it with a pi 3b till I could get my main computer back up and running,  just for email and a little internet surfing. So my thought was,  get a pi 4 8gb and use it as my work computer. I already have a monitor and everything I need to hook it up. 


So on to my question,  anybody think this is a terrible idea and that I should use something else? If it's not a completely terrible idea,  which OS would you recommend for doing basic office tasks, and lastly,  is there a pdf editor for a pi OS? I can't seem to find concrete answers online and am using this as a last resort.  Hopefully you guys have enough experience to recommend me something or tell me how ridiculous I'm being."

raspberry_pi,OMXplayer audio randomly cuts out for a few seconds every ~2 min,"**The Problem**: I made a python script that plays a cartoon video at the push of a button using Omxplayer. It works fine *most* of the time, but occasionally it will have a problem where it cuts out audio for 3-4 seconds every 1 minute 56 seconds. I have been unable to reproduce it at will because a reboot seems to clear the issue.

This problem is driving me nuts. It only happens when I run a video thru the python script and so far has not happened when I execute omxplayer from the command line.

I've tried different methods of using the omxplayer in python, the issue happened in both implementations:

* [https://python-omxplayer-wrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://python-omxplayer-wrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* This has also happened when using the subprocess library to execute the omxplayer.

I've had this happen on two different Pi's: Raspberry Pi 3 B and my current Pi: Raspberry pi 3A+. The way I seemed to have fixed it the first time was by reflashing my Raspberry Pi and configuring everything from scratch. 

This happens on my older Insignia/ Roku TV but not on my Asus monitor with speakers connected to it.

I've done all the basic stuff:

`hdmi_force_hotplug=1`  
`hdmi_group=1`  
`hdmi_mode=16`  
`hdmi_force_edid_audio=1`  
`hdmi_drive=2`  
`config_hdmi_boost=7 &lt;- this did not help so I reverted back`

The logs from /var/log don't tell me anything, and my python script doesn't throw any errors. 

My question is: how can I properly troubleshoot omxplayer audio issues the next time it occurs?"
raspberry_pi,A short wishlist for RPi 5...,"1. Power: PoE hat built in, at least on one model
2. RAM: a single DDR4 SODIMM slot, even just at 2133
3. CPU: an 8-core option would be amazing even if probably out of reach - \*not\* big.LITTLE
4. an m.2 slot, even if only PCIe 2.0 x2
5. clean up the ports: 4x USB-C with power delivery and DP alt mode + 2x GBe is all it really needs. Or, maybe more realistically, just replace the mini HDMIs with USB-C with DP alt mode. DP is far more desirable since it can support HDMI via passive adapter, whereas it doesn't work the other way around

In short:

1. expandability via compatibility with modern laptop parts, even if using them at network appliance speed rather than l33t g4m3r speed
2. a beefier CPU for making containerized multipurpose network appliances
3. modern ports and network-friendly power delivery"

![video](yvh08v5aeou51 "" "")

Hello Everyone. I hope you all be safe at this dangerous time.

I have a problem when running my servomotor with raspberry pi 3 B+. As you all can see in the attached video, the signal coming from raspberry seems to has a lot of noise. What can be the source of this noisy signal?

Note that I powered the raspberry with a micro-USB cable. The servomotor uses the 5V 10A Switching Power Supply.

Any help will be appreciated.

Here is the code that I tried to implement on raspberry:

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

import time

&amp;#x200B;

servoPIN = 18

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

GPIO.setup(servoPIN, GPIO.OUT)

p = GPIO.PWM(servoPIN, 50)

&amp;#x200B;

count = 0

try:

  while True:

print(count)

count += 1

p.ChangeDutyCycle(5)

time.sleep(10)

p.ChangeDutyCycle(12)

time.sleep(5)



except KeyboardInterrupt:

  p.stop()

  GPIO.cleanup()"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi Imager broke TWO of my SD cards. What do I do?,"I tried to Install Retropie, which was a pain in and of itself because the camera I was using (since my mom's computer's SD card reader is wrecked) to let the PC read the SD card was broken. Okay, fine, whatever, it happens. I can't fix it. 

Understandibly, now I'm pissed because I'm not sure if my SD card itself is broken, or my SD card reader I bought from Microcenter is busted. After about an hour of cursing to myself, I check my flip phone, and sure enough, there it is. Another SD card. Thank goodness I don't have to buy another one.

So, I do the same thing again. Try to install retropie into my SD card. Takes longer than watching an entire swimming pool evaporate, but eventually,  I retire from my job, grab my walking cane, greet my kids who are suddenly older than I was when I started this process, and celebrate 50 years of waiting. 

The verify screen comes up. ""Verifying installation"" or whatever. Raspberry Pi imager seems to be going at a more reasonable speed now, and I'm happy that the headache of the first SD card is done, I assumed the card was just bunk or something and tried not to get hung up over it. 

""Verification failed""

A few more bad words and I walk downstairs to where I have the stupid green chip sitting there, smugly, taunting me. I knew it wasn't going to work, I hook it up anyway to my TV, Micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter jerry-rigged to the main HDMI cable my TV uses. Plug in the power supply, and stare at a ""no imput"" screen. Great. Is my Pi DOA? Whatever, time to try this one more time.

Walk back upstairs, annoyed that I spent my entire free time today trying to set something up because I assumed raspberry pis are made to be easy to set up, and customizable, and wouldn't be a headache and a waste of money, as the device is DESIGNED to have software installed on it.

Plug that stupid black plastic into its stupid micro SD card reader into my USB, and look at the drive.

""Please insert a drive into F:/""

You've gotta be kidding me, now I'm close to cursing even here, but for the good of the children who could be reading this, I won't. I know what that message means. It means my SECOND SD card was corrupted again. What a joy! I can't format it, I can't chkdsk it, I can't do anything with it. It's dead, useless, and just a piece of plastic with 128GB stickered on the top of it to taunt me. What do I do? I really give up with this stupid technology. Raspberry Pi, why can't your Raspberry Pi Imager software work? How many mortgages do I have to take out and spend on wholesale SD cards until one of these stuppid things finally decides to flash properly? 

On a serious note, can I fix these cards? And why is this happening? Even rooting my Xiaomi wasn't this much of a headache. Even troubleshooting Manjaro Linux when the forums crashed and lost every relevant noob question, I had an easier time getting it to work. I'm just frustrated, and honestly wanna smash this thing, and accept I wasted money. I regret ever buying one of these things."

My ideas was  now to set up all new and put all ""software"" into a single Docker  container to have a clear overview of all software, seperate them and be  preparte for some further ideas. What do you think about this idea do  this make sense?  Or is there a better solution for this? How would you  do it?

I'm in the planning stages of micro green growing project that is quite small  --kind of a terrarium on steroids size--that needs to have temp and humidity sensors. My initial googles on industrial controls, which may not be the correct direction, came up with PID again and again. For COTS sensors that are likely to be interfaced with the Pi does this make sense? Is it overkill? Is the alternative just on/off with some kind of hysteresis/thresholding in my code?

If anyone has experience with this can you zoom out and walk me through how this works conceptually?"

At work, our bosses just recently announced a ban on all music players with any female data ports, except the 3.5mm jack.  They mentioned specifically that something like an iPod Shuffle would be the only kind of MP3 player that they would allow.  I would rather not downgrade all the way to to an old Shuffle, so I was thinking of building my own solution with a Raspberry Pi.  However, I'm not able to find much information on how to transfer data through the 3.5mm jack the same way that the iPod Shuffle does.  Everything I'm seeing says it's possible but incredibly slow and impractical, and I'm not even sure it would work on the Pi.  Is this project dead in the water?  I can't use Bluetooth to transfer files either, but I could possibly use something shorter range like NFC/Android Beam if I got right down to it, but the 3.5mm jack would be ideal."

The HDMI sound does work when I play something like a youtube video on the Pi. I do not have any extra audio managers ie: pulse audio etc..

I do not want to make my pi a dedicated Stepmania machine and did attempt using [https://github.com/SpottyMatt/raspbian-stepmania-arcade](https://github.com/SpottyMatt/raspbian-stepmania-arcade) build but it gave an invalid terminal error.

I have listed available audio devices and I can see my HDMI is on pughw:0,0 I have also tried hard configuring /boot/config.txt hdmi=2 and switched my Stepmania.ini pughw:2,0 accordingly and no luck.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated right now i'm debating between trying to use pulse audio (doubt this will fix it) and trying to install just a regular linux version of stepmania.

raspberry_pi,GPIO Measures Weird - Trying To Run A Motor - Multimeter Reads Between 0-1.1xxx,"As the title says,  


I am using a Raspberry Pi 4 model B.

This is my code:  


    from gpiozero import Motor
    from signal import pause
    from time import sleep
    
    motor = Motor(forward = 17, backward =27)
    while True:
    	motor.forward()
    	pause()

The pin reffered to as 17, is physical pin 11, and is it the 6th one from J8, on the same row as j8.  


My multimeter is a fluke 117, so it is accurate. It reads 3.3V on the pin, that is suppossed to constantly output 3.3V.  


I am measuring between gnd pin (last physical pin on the same row as J8.) The output of GPIO 17, is strangely fluctuating between 0.17-1.8 and then sometimes it goes 0 flat. The pins are held up by metal ""helping"" arms (the ones used for soldering, I can't remember it's name).  


What is the problem here?"

I will be stationing my Raspberry Pi 4 in a vehicle, which means, that I can't have a normal router.  


I was therefore wondering, how to add wifi to my Raspberry Pi 4, and I came up with the idea of a cellular 4G card.  


Problem is, the only extension board I could find, that allowed for this costs [130 Euro excsl. VAT and shipping](https://www.roundsolutions.com/en/products/internet-of-things-devices/all-iot-devices/10644/aarlogic-raspberry-pi-extension-board-cellular-4gnb1m13g2ggps), which is way over budget  


I was therefore wondering, if any of you had any solutions to this?

raspberry_pi,"Hyperion ng, Raspberry Pi 4 Ambilight","Hey /r/raspberry_pi!

I am trying to make a DIY Ambilight behind my LG 65"" TV using Hyperion (the latest Hyperbian to be precise).

[This is the current setup](https://i.imgur.com/67jKQ6S.jpeg)

My problem is that when I turn the power on, the Grabber works, but as soon as Hyperion starts and the LEDs are turned on, the Grabber stops working. I'd assume it's related to power maybe? But the 100W power supply should be more than enough. Without connecting the LEDs, the Grabber works in Hyperion.

Will it solve my issue if I connect an Arduino via USB and control the LEDs with that instead of directly hooking them up to the Pi 4?

Thank you!"

I am working on a Project to light up my gaming room !

Currently i am still planning the whole Thing...

I already got an Pi3 and bought myself an arduino uno and one meter of WS2812 LED Stripes with 144 leds/m.

I will need more then one meter to lightn up the room. 
I will need about 4 to 5 meters of LED-Stripes.

There comes my question, the LED Stripe needs 5V with 60mA per LED (manufacturer information).
Ist this too much for my setup?

Thinking about switching to an stripe with less LEDs/m...

Or do i have to get more arduinos to get enough Power supply ?"

I work in IT and have worked with heaps of different technologies. I'm very familiar with figuring things out myself and sorting out issues like this but this has me stumped.

I have an SD card that was in my rpi 3 and was working perfectly fine. I decided I wanted to repurpose it for a different project so as always I went to format it and burn a new fresh image to it using etcher.

Etcher failed so I thought the image was the issue. I tried another SD card and it worked fine, so the SD card obviously has a problem.

No worries, I'll just format it properly and then start with a fresh slate. Well, on my windows PC formatting it through every method available just does nothing. Like, nothing. Some methods say ""failed"", some say ""success"" but the SD card is untouched.

It previously had Raspbian on it so it has the handy ""boot"" partition as well as the ext4(?) Partition, and nothing wipes those away.

I've tried disk management as that normally works. Just right click and delete on either partition changes nothing. It just stays there.

I've tried chkdsk to look for bad sectors and it didn't say anything was wrong.

I've tried diskpart to format it but nothing happens. It says ""diskpart successfully formatted the volume"" but everything is still as it was.

So what gives? What should I try next? The SD card seems to work fine otherwise so I don't want to throw it away just yet."

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

raspberry_pi,Building a media Streamer,"Hello!  I'm sick of being advertised too every where.  So, I'm going to build an HTPC that will do 4K, all the HDR, Atmos, etc.  KODI and plex will be the primary means of watching with Youtube a close third.   


What OS should I install such that I can block YT adds?  Judging from the below list of needs, I'll need one of the full fledged operating systems, no?  OSMC advertises a pre-built box, but I could achieve the same output with a new Pi board right?

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pj 4 unusably slow,"I have recently bought two Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GB of RAM. I needed two more to add to my collection of six Raspberry Pi 3b+. I chose the 2GB model because it worked fine for my use case on the Pi 3b+, which is displaying web based dashboards on a monitor all day long.

My first experiences of the Pi 4 are not great. They boot and load programs incredibly slow. They both run the latest version of Raspbian (one pi runs the full version and one the regular one) on a 16GB SD card. I have tried both other OS and other versions of Raspbian, with similar results. 

I made a video to demonstrate how slow basic tasks are processed. A simple program is opened to disable the screensaver, Chromium is opened, Google.com and Amazon.com are opened and lastly I open up a terminal to check RAM usage. This takes over 5 minutes. This is recorded in the full version of Raspbian. 

Is this expected behavior?

raspberry_pi,Getting an SPI screen and GPIO controls working together,"I posted this in r/retropie but hoping someone here has encountered this. I've googled everywhere and found someone with a similar issue but it didn't work for me.

Completely knew to Pi. Been working on my first build that hasn't been a premade kit and have problems. 

Bought a cheap ili9341 SPI screen, followed some tutorials to get it running at 60fps and its great.

Next used GPIOnext to get the controller working. All wired up. Works perfect.

Now heres my problem...I can not get them working together!! The GPIO set up clashed with the screen. I set the screen up first. After installing gpionext it breaks it. I then use the set pin command for gpionext to only use the gpio pins I need. Screen comes back to life but I can not get the thing to the open the gpio config to actually define the control. When I do use a workaround to boot, it fails when configuring control 1 and crashes. 

If I do it the other way and install gpionext first , define pins, so its working....Then install screen drivers the screen will not display when using con2fbmap 1 1. I know there must be a conflict still.

If anyone has a solution for this, I would hugely appreciate it. Its driving me crazy now and must have done at least 5 fresh installs trying various work arounds. I dontnrequire gpionext, just anything that will get me a 4 way dpad and at least 5 action buttons. Thanks!!!!

raspberry_pi,"An arcade gaming machine based on Raspberry Pi 3b+, a 80's Bang Olufsen TV and Pi2SCART","This is my arcade machine project, consisting of a RPi 3b+, Arcadeforge's Pi2SCART and an old Bang Olufsen MX2000 TV. Working time was approximately two weeks in a shared basement with rather basic tools... and yes, the control panel became up-side down during painting/mounting... I realized my error a bit too late and couldn't be bother more, but I got it some cup holders in compensation! :-)

Most of the cabinet is made of plywood. First time for me to use that, but I found it very pleasent to use. No screws were used, but rather dowels and glue. Some scrap wood was used in the inner support foundation. The initial idea was to have the cabinet wall-hanged, but it turned out using an old TV makes it (very) heavy, so I scrapped that idea. Two 120 mm fans and a ventilation grill is placed on the back for ventilation. If I would do this again I wouldn't remove as much of the TVs plastic casing as I did - especially the front casing which holds the TVs plastic front-screen... it took a lot of time to get the curvature right! I did not intend to modify the TV itself, except from discharging it and move the speakers from below the screen to top of the cabinet.

raspberry_pi,I was wanting to run an ADC chip that requires a 40mhz clock signal and puts out a signal when the data is ready to read.. Are these speeds not possible on the GPIO pins?,"For starters I am more into micro controllers and circuits. I have a few PIs laying around and have played with them enough to get the GPIOs working. I'm working with a rasp PI 4 B (waiting on adapters) and an Asus tinker board, and some older/smaller ones. 

I was really hoping to make a digital oscilloscope using old SPT7863 40msps ADC chips I picked up. I was running into not enough ram on the micro controllers and thought using a PI would solve that and the display needs. But after some trial and error and a bunch of research I'm not sure these PIs will do what I need. 

The ADC chip needs a 40mhz clock signal. And at the same frequency it will put out a data ready to read signal. So that signal needs to trip an interrupt then the 10bit value of the reading is read by reading 10 pins from the chip (called parallel output).

I designed a nice custom PCB board to go on my PI, but luckily I decided to test the GPIOs before I messed with etching the board out and soldering it. I have yet to get the GPIOs to work that fast. But my programing skills really are only in the Processing platform, which is way to slow, and I have done some GPIO bash scripts way back and would need a refresher course.. But I was looking into python and wiringPI. And after all that I was starting to think the GPIO side of PIs might not be able to handle the speeds. So I figured I would just ask before I wasted to much more time.  Here is my PCB design, Ya I though I was going to have 2 channels. That's reading 20 pins 40 million times a second, not counting the clock signal. https://i.imgur.com/rqYod2B.png

Here is the datasheet for the ADC chip for those interested. I got them cheap on ebay because they are outdated and obsolete. https://www.datasheetq.com/datasheet-download/631849/1/Fairchild/SPT7863


So should should I look back towards using a micro controller for the main work or do you think there is a chance this could work out on a PI?"

raspberry_pi,First Raspberry Pi Project Ever.,"Hi all!  I'm new to raspberry pi and the raspi community.  In fact I'm new to microcontrollers entirely.  I had a need for a product that could stream wireless video to OBS without the need for running extra software.  It had to be light, wearable, energy efficient battery powererd, automatic, and (preferably cheap).  After running down many failed options over a year, I came cross some promising ideas with Raspberry PI, and after cobbling together many different tutorials (code stuff is not my expertise...) I managed to come up with a working v1.  Afterwards, I needed a way to passively keep the Raspberry Pi cool and also make it wearable (making stuff is more of my strongpoint).  So here's my working prototype wireless streaming camera, it has a custom aluminum case I designed and casted myself that also serves as a heat sink and strap clamp, and a custom mount to hook the lens on to the side of my glasses."

Hi all.

Im trying to get to work a mcp23017 on a raspberry pi zero w.

I put

    i2cdetect -y 1 

But... is flapping. i connected the mcp23017 like this.

3.3v to Vdd

GND to Vss

SDA TO SDA

SCL TO SCL

and put a address.

In my config.txt i have

    dtparam=i2c_vc=on dtparam=i2c_arm=on dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=100000 

I see the mcp23017 a moment yes, and a moment no. (i try a lot of different mcp23017 and two raspberry pi zero w with the same result).

Seagate USB 3 1TB HDD connected through a powered hub.

Gigabit Swtich

So my Pi4 is connected to my gigabit switch by a Cat6 ethernet cable. I have tested the exact port with the exact same cable and I'm getting Gigabit speeds on both my laptop and PC.

I've also tested the Seagate USB HDD on both of these machine and I'm getting USB 3 speeds when transferring both small and large files.

I have tried the drive connected to the Pi4 is 3 formats: NTFS, EXT4 and FAT32. I have tried 2 different SD cards. I have also tried a Western Digital USB 3 HDD

I have tried with and without the quirks enabled for both HDDs

I have tried mounting with ntfs-3g when using NTFS.

I have tried several different forms of transfer, wget, http, ftp, smb etc.

No matter what I try, the scenario is the same. The speed starts off at around 80MB/s and starts immediately dropping until it averages out at about 12MB/s

I thought this was a buffer problem but I've tried 2 HDDs and 2 Flash Drives, all USB 3

I know the pie is up and running, since I can ping it and I can connect to it with Putty. It's like it doesn't want to generate an image, unless I've plugged in a screen...

Anyone got any help? Is there some setting I need to tweak?"
raspberry_pi,Confused on chromium processes/usage,"Hi All,

I am playing around with setting up a dashboard for my home network on a 3a+. In doing so, I am see that after a few hours, my Pi becomes unresponsive and requires a reboot to get working again. Investigating the issue, I found that chromium was consuming all memory as well as swap space. I bumped my swap to 1gb but am still trying to understand why I see two different types of chromium processes with htop.

I understand multiple are expected but as the CLI arguments are different between them, that is the confusing aspect.

Anyone care to share some insights?

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/j1oeaf/2020_sep_28_stickied_%F0%9D%90%87%F0%9D%90%84%F0%9D%90%8B%F0%9D%90%8F%F0%9D%90%83%F0%9D%90%84%F0%9D%90%92%F0%9D%90%8A_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 4 &amp; Kali Linux 64bit airodump-ng will work for 30ish seconds before it stops capturing,"Good Afternoon All,


I have been practicing an Ethical Hacking course from UDEMY. I have been running some -ng commands on my WEP wifi to practice and get a feel for Pen Testing. I have always been extremely interested in Pen Testing and hope to one day be certified! Whenever I run the airodump-ng wlan0mon command I can gather all the information about my router and clients connected to it (exciting)! However, after about 10-30 seconds of running this it stops gathering information and the information that was showing slowly starts to disappear from the terminal. After this I can kill the program from running in the terminal and try to start it again. However, it seems like any -ng commands lag in the terminal until I reboot after the -ng commands stop working.



Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4

OS: Kali Linux 2020.3 64bit for RPi4

Wifi Adapter: Internal Raspberry Pi 4 Wifi adapter until my external Alfa comes in the mail.

Output of commands:

1) sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off (I have somewhat better luck when I turn off the Rasp Pi 4 wifi power management mode)

2) sudo airmon-ng check kill

3) sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

4) sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

*airodump-ng gathers data about the router / clients and eventually stops

5) CTRL-C to kill the program

6) sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

*airodump-ng lags the terminal hard and never displays any router/client information until I fully reboot and rerun the commands. Works again for 10-30 seconds.


I can also deauth for about 10-30 seconds before the program freezes? Resources on the Rasp Pi 4 are very low. CPU - 10% and RAM - 20% (4gb version).

I also have a fan so I don't think it would be overheating (doesn't feel hot)


Error Message: None

Links to same problem: None

Attempts to fix: 

1) I have seen other users say to turn off the Power Management mode on the wifi and while this helps sometimes the -ng commands never last more than 30 seconds.

2) New/fresh flash

3) apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade

Thanks, SBP"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry pi Guacamole Performance," Hi all

I am currently running this image on docker on my raspberry pi 3b+: [https://github.com/oznu/docker-guacamole](https://github.com/oznu/docker-guacamole)

Performance for an RDP session for my local computer is lacking. I have tried enabling websockets and lowering the resolution for the RDP connection, but it's still quite slow. It also doesn't seem like the pi processor is getting maxed out either. For testing purposes, I am running the pi and the client computer on the same lan.

Things I've done:

1. Tested on macbook on the same lan: Guacamole is slow. RDP client is fast
2. Network speed test with iperf:  160 Mbits/sec  
3. Firefox and chrome browsers both say that websockets are functioning
4.  VNC into my pie and ran remima from the pi desktop and remima is much smoother with rdp than guacamole 

What is everyone else's experience running guacamole on a 3 b+? If anyone has it up and running smoothly, can you give some extra details about your setup ?

raspberry_pi,Raspberry pi gps puzzle,"Hi guys, I’m new to the pi world and trying to learn some things. I’ve got a Pi 4, a senseHAT, and a usb dongle and I’ve been trying to code a puzzle box that requires someone to take the pi (I built a box for a case and have it working with a battery) to a series of set locations before “unlocking” (displaying a little open lock on the senseHAT LEDs with a scrolling message). 

I’ve been using [this](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-puzzle-box/15) tutorial. 

My big holdup is that

from pigps import GPS

gives me the following error:
ImportError: cannot import name ‘gps’ from ‘pigps’

Is this telling me that PiGPS isn’t installed properly? I’ve tried doing it again with a fresh install of raspbian and I’m driving myself crazy trying to sort it out. 

TIA!"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry pi not connecting?,"Hello,  
I recently got my old raspberry pi 0 out and decided to turn it into a pi-hole to block ads. I put Raspberry Pi OS Lite on it as my operating system. I got it set up and ran internet to it with a USB to ethernet adapter(its lights up when it's working properly). I was then testing different sites to see how well it was working, it was working great.... for 5 min. I reloaded the web interface to see how many ads had been blocked but the page wouldn't load. Went to my pi and noticed the ethernet adapter was not lit up, checked my routers attached devices and it wasn't showing up. I restarted it and checked all my connections(checking to make sure it was all in the right plugs, even trying different cords for everything) , reset my router back to the previous settings but nothing was working. I tried a keyboard on the pi and it worked fine, tried the ethernet adapter on my laptop and it worked fine. What I concluded from this was something had happened with the software, so I reset the SD card and reinstalled the os. Ran it back up and .... nothing, well nothing from the ethernet adapter, everything else botted fine (I even check my router again). Now I am at a loss of what is wrong and was hoping to get some insight on why it's not working.

Tl;dr: Tried to install pi-hole on raspbery pi 0. It worked for 5 min now ethernet dosent work on it even after resetting it.

raspberry_pi,Webcam/Camera/USB Camera that has H264 encoder?,"I have a Pi4 4GB I purchased purely to render a PIP video with two video inputs for an output rmtp live stream. I've purchased 3 different webcams and can't find one with a H264 hw encoder. h264 hw encoder is pivotal since if I have to re-encode MJPG, it's too slow for a live stream.

To determine whether the camera has a H264 encoder, I run ""v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext""

The first didn't explicitly state that it had an H264 encoder (Aluratek) so thats on me. The command showed YUYV and MJPG, which makes sense given the packaging. After that, I did a bit of research and bought the the Red Dragon GW800 which states H264 on the package. Once again, the command revealed the same. So I saw that the Logitech C270 was used on many Pi's and had hardware encoding, but I get the same result...

I'm frustrated.

I'm trying to hook a couple of Pis up to some old CRTs that I have for various reasons.  To do this, I'm trying to use the built in Composite, since using that doesn't introduce the added complexity of an HDMI -&gt; Composite converter.

I've simplified my test down to:

- Go to NOOBS splash screen
- press 4 (NTSC composite)
- connect composite

and I get no usable composite.

I hook up my oscilloscope, and I see a waveform that resembles a composite waveform, but my old TVs show nothing, and my LG 43UM7300 (4K TV) says No Signal on composite.

Is the signal too weak?

On my desktop arch linux with kde plasma, i am able to connect to my vpn client and then share my internet connections with clients using network manager. However I am trying to do the same thing with my raspberry pi, running raspbian with mate desktop and network manager. I am running into a few problems.  


I cannot create a bridge of eth0 &amp; wlan0 with network manager. Not a working one, dnsmasq will not give out ip's through it. I tried nmcli with no luck.   


Also before i would share the connection by going to the ipv4 tab of the vpn connected and changing its type to shared. That option is not available on raspbian's network manager.   


So my question is how does kde plasmas network manager differ to raspbians.  


Or if you know how i would do this with iptables, i can forget all about network manager.  


Again my scenario is this. The RPI will connect to the internet and the vpn, then route internet connections to the clients over a wired/wireless bridge, so they will get internet that also goes through the vpn client.  


Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?

9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

raspberry_pi,Pi W as AP. unable to set static ip,"Hi there,  


I just started my first project with a raspberry pi and every has been going smooth till this point.  
I've configured the pi W to be an AP by using an extra adapter.

The whole system is currently using wpa-supplicant for the inbound and outbound connections.  
All my devices are able to connect and also connect to the internet except for 1 device.

This device is having issues getting an IP and keeps telling me to check the DHCP server.

&amp;#x200B;

After some research, i found out that device can have issues if you are not an static IP for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been searching a bit but i'm unable to find any way to set a static ip for a device when using wpa-supplicant.

Is there anyone who can shed some light on this issue or recommends something to switch the interface with another service and which one?

&amp;#x200B;

However, it does require a strong network connection, so when playing from my bedroom Stadia does become unplayable (as the wifi router is on the the other side of the house).

In an atempt to fix this I'm using a powerline ethernet adaptor - connected from my router to a Raspberry Pi configured as an access point. 

The AP works great apart from when I play Stadia through it, is there anything I can change to the Pi (software or hardware) to get it to handle Stadia streaming a bit better?

Note: I don't want to connect the powerline straight into my PC as I need my other wireless devices to connect to the AP.

On startup, everything seems to be fine; after a while (usually a few hours -- definitely less than a day), the networking stack stops working -- I cant ping/VNC to it, and outgoing pings show remote IPs are unavailable.  However, the wifi icon in the menu bar still shows a connection to my router.

I upgraded to the latest version of RPi OS, turned of wireless power management, and tried rebooting the wireless stack (the latter two were both suggestions from [https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry\_pi/comments/3ua1m8/raspberry\_pi\_wifi\_disassociates\_after\_a\_few\_days/?utm\_source=BD&amp;utm\_medium=Search&amp;utm\_name=Bing&amp;utm\_content=PSR1](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/3ua1m8/raspberry_pi_wifi_disassociates_after_a_few_days/?utm_source=BD&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_name=Bing&amp;utm_content=PSR1) )  I used the newer command for rebooting the stack; when I did so, the wifi was no longer connected, but didn't auto reconnect; it also didn't show the list of wifi networks available in the menu bar drop-down.

Just a quick question. I've searched around but can't seem to find an answer.

I'm trying to overclock my Pi4 (yes I have heatsinks and active cooling), I'm running Retropie and I've opened the config.txt file via WinSCP.

I've placed the following commands:

&gt;arm\_freq=2000                                
&gt;  
&gt;over\_voltage=6                                
&gt;  
&gt;gpu\_freq=600 

under the section that says:

&gt;\#uncomment to overclock the arm. 700 MHz is the default.

Refer to this screenshot:  https://imgur.com/yTFH3L1 

But now looking at a few tutorials, a lot of people are saying that you're supposed to put the overclocking commands under the section that says \[pi4\].

So my question is, does it matter whereabouts I put those overclocking commands in the config file? Or does it specifically have to be under the \[pi4\] section."

raspberry_pi,[GUIDE] Setup portrait mode for RasPi 4 + offical touchscreen 2020,"Hello folks,

It seems that in newer versions of raspberry OS the old methods with lcd\_rotate etc. don't work anymore. So i spent some time to figure out a new method to turn your screen around. So i thought i share my solution with you, maybe it can help someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the method that worked for me:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Edit /boot/config.txt

open termnial and type:

`sudo nano /boot/config.txt`

go to the end of the config file and add:

`display_lcd_rotate=1` for 90° rotation

or 

`display_lcd_rotate=3` for 270° rotation

Save the file.

&amp;#x200B;

This will swap your screen orientation, but your touchscreen input will be off.

&amp;#x200B;

2) get your touchscreen name:

open terminal and use:

`xinput --list`

`DISPLAY=:0 xinput --list //if you are connected over SSH`

Get the name of your touchscreen from the list. In my case the name of the offical pi touchscreen is 'raspberrypi-ts'. (not ft5406, it seems that changed with the recent updates of raspberry OS)

&amp;#x200B;

3) create bash script to swap touch input

create a new file:

`nano /home/pi/swapinput`

type in following code for 90° orientation:

`#!/bin/bash`

`xinput --set-prop 'raspberrypi-ts' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1/sw`

type in follwing code for 270° orientation

`#!/bin/bash`

`xinput --set-prop 'raspberrypi-ts' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1/sw`

save the file.

&amp;#x200B;

4) add the created script to autostart

type in terminal:

`sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart` 

add following line:

`@sh /home/pi/swapinput`

Done. Save the file.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Reboot and everything should work fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this little guide is helpful."

raspberry_pi,Can’t access Nvidia Shield over network,"I have just moved house and have transferred both my Nvidia shield and raspberry pi over to the new place and hooked them both up to the new internet. 

At my old place, I’d activated local network sharing on the shield and could then access it from my raspberry pi by going through the file app Go&gt;Network, and the shield would appear. 

Since I moved, all that appears in this section is “Windows Network” and I can’t access the Nvidia shield or the harddrive attached to it. It’s probably worth noting that I can access the shield through my windows PC over network just fine. 

This is getting really frustrating now and any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

raspberry_pi,Is a Pi0 a decent option for a smart mirror compared to a Pi 4b?,"I’ve been wanting to use a Pi to create a smart mirror for some time.

I found this product on amazon that has the frame and mirror already set up for a project:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083V7RK8H/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9-PAFbQB4PCG7

However, from what I can tell that while a Raspberry Pi 4b will fit, it means needing two separate power sources. On the other hand a Pi 0 will fit and be able to use the supplied power source.

My question is that when you’re building something like a smart mirror, is “downgrading” to a Pi 0 going to be very limiting?"

raspberry_pi,Implementation of Adafruit FONA 808 Cellular Breakout Board for Raspberry Pi Zero W?,"Hi all, 

I've been drawing up an embedded security device design using a Raspberry Pi Zero W. However, this device would likely be in locations without WiFi and therefore cellular connectivity would be ideal. I wanted to ask this community if anyone had any success with the Adafruit FONA board in particular or another cellular breakout board with sufficient documentation. I've seen other HATs that provide the Pi Zero with cellular but are often criticized online for failing after short periods of time or not including enough documentation on their implementation. Here's the breakout board I currently have:  [https://www.adafruit.com/product/2542](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2542).

This relies upon its own LiPo battery to handle the large current spikes (up to 2A), which is rather inconvenient, as I already have another LiPo battery with a charge controller circuit that I've set up with the Pi Zero. Any input or suggestions for this project would be greatly appreciated!"

I can access my Transmission-daemon from my other devices again, but that is about it. I know this is really a few problems, but I'm assuming it is all coming back to my new network environment and I'munsure how to proceed.

I've just upgraded my broadband and thought I'd test network speed from my Pi4 4MB, having never tried before.  
Appears that I'm only getting 80-90 Mbps vs \~ 500Mbps on my desktop pc, I used the same Google speed test on both so they are comparable and I'm not getting my units mixed up :-)  
All my network is gigabit, both desktop and Pi4 look to be connected with Cat 5e cable, the network light on the port shows green.  


Just in case, I swapped the cables over (keeping each plugged into the same port the other end) and no change to speeds, so the network cables are not the issue.

Any thing obvious you guys can think may be the problem - I don't need the full speed but would be interesting to figure it out.

raspberry_pi,Dedicated Zoom Station -- Switching users?,"Some background:  I have two kids at home doing their schooling over zoom.  They have PE and dance classes that need to be done in the living room so they have room to move around.  My daughter brings her laptop down and my son, his tablet.  The problem is, when they're moving around, they have a hard time seeing the teacher on the (relatively) small screens.  So my wife asked if there was a way they could hook up to the (relatively) big TV screen.  I said yes...

And then I started thinking about a Raspberry Pi.  What if I hooked a Pi with a webcam up to the TV and just left it there all the time to use with zoom?  Would that work?  Apparently, according to [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ia1e12/i_built_a_raspberry_pi_zoomputer_instructions_in/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/im8e5b/video_conferencing_system/) as well as [this article from the Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/working-from-home-with-your-raspberry-pi/) it *is* possible.  Cool!  The kids could use it for class and we could even use it as a family to visit with my oldest who's away at college.

But then I realized that each kid needs to be logged into their own personal school district account to use zoom for class.  That would be a pain to have to log out someone else's account and then log in to your own each time.  So, is there a simpler way to set things up to switch between multiple users?  (Note -- I'm not worried about user security for this.)

Also, I'm thinking of a simple wireless keyboard/touchpad and a cheap usb webcam -- would I need anything else (aside from the Pi and assorted cables and such)?"

I started on this right when it came out and I got an order in..and then COVID hit.  Hasn't been easy to work on with a four year old running around and progress has been in slow spurts but it's really coming together at this point.

![img](etaym2s7b7o51)

![img](yq7iw3s7b7o51)

![img](guba54s7b7o51)

&amp;#x200B;

Camera is powered by a pair of 18650 batteries going through a buck converter to put out 5v power to the pi.  On the back I have a 3.2"" Adafruit screen to view what I'm shooting as well as view pictures when I get that part working.

I currently have OpenCV running when I press a button, it uses edge detection to show me what's in focus.  Hijacked from a demo but it's working for me.

&amp;#x200B;

![video](n8q094oxb7o51)

Next I'll be 3d printing a case, the frame I presently printed has some issues with the shutter button hitting the buck converter.  I'll post it once I can get that finished.

&amp;#x200B;

The frame was 3D printed, but my design was bad so the shutter button hit into the buck converter...next time you see it things will be more together.

Currently it's powered through a battery pack I built which holds two 18650 cells going into a Drok buck converter to bring them to 5v

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 3.2"" adafruit screen on the back to which I added the four buttons...they'll eventually be used for playing and deleting images.  Holding a focus assist button down brings up an OpenCV window.  I'm using its edge detection algorithm from the demo to draw a green line over what is in focus.

Not an overwhelming expert on this, but Starting from a bunch of extra parts from that project, I built another 7.4v battery pack from some 18650 cells and wired it all the same...the resulting pack goes through a step down converter to bring it down to 5v.  The issue I had in the past was the occasional power spike when turning it all on which had me thinking.  Would I be better off running them in Series instead of Sequence giving me a stronger mah 3.5v pack and then using a step up converter to feed into the pi?  I see an Adafruit PowerBoost1000 which would then allow me to charge from inside the unit as well once everything is closed up without worrying about removing batteries to recharge.

raspberry_pi,Can raspberry pi handle multipoint bluetooth?,"Not sure what that is? Read here:

[https://www.soundguys.com/bluetooth-multipoint-explained-28601/](https://www.soundguys.com/bluetooth-multipoint-explained-28601/)

There aren't many headphones out there that can do it. BUT, that got me thinking....if the headphones were connected to a raspberry pi as a single connection, and the raspberry pi was connected to a phone, a computer, maybe another phone or computer, then maybe you could essentially do the same thing with whatever headphones you want. 

It wouldn't have to be terribly portable for most users since you'd likely only really need it when all your devices are together, like at a desk. But sure, would be neat to have it packaged as a portable device as well.

But the big question here, is Can the raspberry pi even handle that? Zero W would be most ideal in this case. I don't know a ton about bluetooth streams, limitations, and how they are handled. I just had to fight with my computer because I found out that my headphones get listed as headphones And a headset at the same time. Windows has it's own device driver that controls the switch between those, and allows for multiple bluetooth device definitions....but sentinel (our virus software) was blocking that from installing properly...from microsoft \*facepalm\*. After me fighting a bunch with it and figuring out the issue myself, I made a ticket and IT was able to fix it in 5 minutes. 

But wasn't sure if rPi would have similar issues, since handling that sort of thing would be through a second/third driver for one device. So yes, this is likely quite complicated. But if I learn that it's Possible, then I'm very interested in learning how to create it. And shoot, would be awesome to see about making an actual device, portable, with a battery and everything."

Tracking the current data on the daily impact of the coronavirus had encumbered lots of my friends' and acquaintances' thought processes due to the uncertain data update times. Hence, I developed a bot hosted by a Raspberry Pi, which notifies the user when there is a change in the daily case report of the selected country via WhatsApp, in the hope of soothing their minds even a little bit. In other words, you will get notified via WhatsApp (as notification messages) when the daily case report of your country is uploaded or updated by the data provider - The 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) with the support of ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). Also, the notifier bot sends an information message in the given period if there is no change (STABLE)."

I am fond of experimenting with the Raspberry Pi camera options (such as image effects and duration) while recording demonstration videos for my electronics projects, and especially when birdwatching in my balcony :) When I take a video with my Raspberry Pi for the mentioned reasons, I usually upload the video to my YouTube channel, as a private video, due to the storage limit on Pi. However, the process of recording and uploading through Raspberry Pi had miscellaneous and intricate steps to follow all over again: adjusting video settings manually, opening my YouTube channel, defining video parameters, etc.

Thus, I contemplated a GUI by which I could adjust the video recording settings and define the parameters to upload videos to YouTube without signing to my YouTube channel on the browser every time. After some research, I decided to use the Google APIs Client Library for Python to communicate with my YouTube channel through the YouTube Data API. In the end, I developed a GUI (YouTube Video Recorder and Uploader) in Python, including two interfaces - Record menu and Upload menu."

I've been running it on a variety of random power plugs on my desk,  500ma / 1000ma USB ports on PCs - also ran it from a USB battery pack - my desk is a mess and I've been busy and distracted.

Either way, somehow, I finally decided today to pay attention to it and I notice a red light comes on, HDMI signal isn't sent and no eth lights.

raspberry_pi,Controlling GPIO with gpio mode in and out,"Is it safe to just use gpio mode 0 out and gpio mode 0 in to turn a relay on and off?

Currently all GPIO pins are set to In by default. Running a script to change them all to out causes the relays to come on until you gpio write &lt;pin&gt; 1. So instead of the relays clicking on and immediately off whenever the Pi starts, is it safe to just switch the pins between in and out modes as necessary to turn the relay on/off that way?"

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi Adjustable Air Quality Detector Running on GUI,"I had been working on a project with which I could collate air quality information from an MQ-135 Air Quality Sensor to detect the occurrence of the deteriorating air quality in my workplace. However, the positioning of the MQ-135 Air Quality Sensor has gigantic importance while collecting pristine information from the sensor. Therefore, I decided to make a moveable sensor base via selected angles by developing a user-friendly interface. To achieve that goal and add a few corroborating features such as adjustable background light, I developed a GUI using the guizero module in Python for my Raspberry Pi, named Air Quality Module.

Via Air Quality Module, you can control two servo motors attached to the mini pan-tilt kit by choosing one of the given angles - 0, 30, 45, 90, 135, 180 - and adjust the background light in RGB format - 255, 255, 255. And, most importantly, you can monitor the current air quality range generated by the MQ-135 sensor: the GUI notifies you with a warning message if the air quality is deteriorating.

Formatting with ext4 results in the same errors howerver.  

It must be a problem of my pi or Linux in general.

2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.) You're not going to damage your Pi by running too many things at once, so try running all your programs before worrying about needing more processing power or multiple Pis.
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi as a replacement for a Chromecast Audio - RaSpotify is excellent.,"First a bit of a rant...

I've had Chromecasts since not long after they were introduced, and have trying to use one with an HMDI to audio adapter as a Spotify music source for years.  It is essentially a Chromecast Audio, and it (and all my Chromecasts) have always been a real pain in the ass.

I recently tried using it for audio streaming again, and it repeatedly stops playing after a minute or two.  It also often loses connection to my phone and I have to restart the phone, or kill and restart the Spotify app to get it to work again.  I went checked for a Chromecast upgrade, did a factory reset, tried a different phone and did all the troubleshooting I could do, no improvement.  IMO and experience for the last 6 years, Google's Chromecast is often so unstable it is unusable.  

Eventually found that there are a lot of people having the same problem on what should be a mature, stable platform.  There is no time frame for any fix.  Since Google can't produce a stable platform after *seven years* of trying, it was time to look elsewhere.

End rant.

RaSpotify

I installed Raspotify on the Pi I'm using for VPN, and the damn thing works flawlessly.  The sound quality is just as good as the Chromecast and it is completely reliable.  After a week I have yet to have the slightest bit of trouble with it - music plays without stopping and the Spotify app always responds to the phone's playback controls.  It has not lost connection to the Pi once.

I'll be buying a 2nd PI for another room.

If you haven't tried RaSpotify as a music source, give it a shot - it is a great solution for music streaming."

raspberry_pi,Seeking best value solid state storage for cluster,"Background:

Have a raspberry pi 4 cluster all configured to my liking. Everything is usb boot, k8s, even ceph is working now... but I've \*just\* learned that there is a real difference between actual solid state drives and even high end usb 3.1 thumbdrives. My disk performance is terrible. With my drives I'm only getting about 48Mb/s sequential. the distributed storage is unsurprisingly much worse (network shows gigabit throughput... drives are the problem). I've scouring the internet for options, but I'm in this state because I didn't get it right the first time, so it's time to see if others already know.

TLDR:

Any recommendations on solid state usb drives that can fit into both usb 3 slots (system drive, storage drive)? the [san disk extreme pro](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/usb-flash-drives/sandisk-extreme-pro-usb-3-1) is the closest I've found in the same form factor genre.

I'm thinking of building an additional off-site storage solution from a spare Raspberry Pi 3b I have lying around that I'm thinking of putting this at my in-laws house. I'd like suggestions on how to set this up to meet the following requirements:
1. Run on a raspi 3b with an external drive. 
2. Not have to touch the in-laws' router. No port forwarding on that end. 
3. Be as resistant as possible to anything nefarious that might be crawling around their network. Consider this an untrusted network. 
4. Minimal administration needed. Mainly I want it to come back to life if it loses power and/or internet. Automatic updates needed. Email notification of problems would be a plus.

My current idea is to use the raspi with Syncthing installed. Then have it connect OpenVPN/Wireguard back to a server at my house. All traffic configured to go over this VPN. Maybe some scripting needed to detect if the VPN is working and reset it after some time. 

Any better ideas?"

raspberry_pi,TRIM support on Raspberry Pi external USB SSDs,"I've been doing a lot of testing with external SSDs on the Pi 4, since it has USB 3.0 and can support much better speed/performance through an SSD than the built-in microSD card (especially for booting and running things).

Today, after a few people were asking me about TRIM support on the Pi 4, I spent some time reading through a Raspberry Pi forum post ([this post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1708655#p1708655) by tom.ty89), and was able to determine that a couple of my SSDs supported TRIM, but none of them worked with TRIM out of the box. I had to switch the `provisioning_mode` for each one of them following tom's advice.

I wrote up a blog post (will link it in the comments) on the process, and just wanted to share my findings because some people I know have had a lot of trouble getting TRIM working with their own Pis.

Why is TRIM important? It is kind of like 'garbage collection' for SSDs, and when it's enabled, it can help reduce the amount of time it takes to write new data (in some cases), and also extend the life of the SSD (slightly) if you use it a lot.

I believe all the info applies on older Pi models too, though their slower USB 2.0 ports and shared IO bus mean the benefits might not be as great in terms of any performance gain."

I wanted to buy a RPi 4 to use it as an host for, let's say, 7 virtual machines with 512mb of memory each and a lightweight distro (lubuntu, or even puppy).

The question is: would the Pi 4 run virtual machines (KVM maybe?) ? How many could I run? It's worth to buy the 8GB version to make even more virtual machines?

raspberry_pi,One of our Raspberrys out in the wild,
raspberry_pi,my input GPIO is always detecting inputs.,"i  have been following  [this](https://www.explainingcomputers.com/pi_gpio_inputs_video.html) tutorial  to make a simple button input and for some reason regardless of which pin i use or how i wire them .  my  pi  seems to always detect an input when i set my pin to input mode.

i checked for shorts and bad wireing on my end and its exactly how the circuit should be exept its directly wired instead of a bread board  but my pi seems to ignore my button and detect input  regardless of weather  my button is pushed or not .   i have tried both resistor arrangements mentioed in that video as well .      i also have tried disconnecting the wires leading to the input pin to see if the output changes while the code is running.   but it seems to keep detecting an input .

the only time it did not detect anything was when i started the program with nothing connected.

i checked with ground pin or 3v3 pin disconnected as well.

ATM i am using a 1m long wire between my button and the  10k resistor to my input pin so my button can be a bit furthur away from the pi itself.

also there is no actual button in the wireing i  have cut the middle of the wire where the button should be and connect the two sides by hand to close my circuit .  technically it should act like a poor mans button .

my pi is connected to my pc by VNC viewer as i dont have a spare monitor.

there is probably a noob mistake somwhere in there and any help for finding it is appreciated ."

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)

9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)

A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)

A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Just to be clear that ssh won't be used over the internet but locally only so will it in any way change the ip on the local network if I disconnect and reconnect to the network or will the local ip stays static.

raspberry_pi,What can Open Media Vault on my Pi give me that a Raspberry Pi OS based server can't?,"I've been trying to set up an Open Media Vault (OMV) home server.  I've got the basic system running ok, but adding additional functionality is looking increasingly fiddly.  I'd normally relish this sort of technical challenge, but in recent times I've been pretty time-poor, owing to now being the father of a very active little two-year-old.   So I certainly don't have the hours I used to have to spend hours researching how to get something working.

So I'm seeking views on whether I'm missing out in any way if I just base my server on the default Raspberry Pi OS?    Is there anything that I can do with OMV that I can't do with this?

My planned setup is:

- a Raspberry Pi 4 8gb model, connected to the network via 1GB Ethernet

- 1TB SSD to allow me and my partner to have a common place to share photos and videos and other files

- 4TB HHD for media storage, and

- (to come) a large HHD for backups of laptops, phones, and tablets (with manual copies taken off this for storage off-site)

 My needs are:

- Streaming media files on the 4TB to devices attached to the network (to our tablets, but also to another Raspberry Pi running Kodi, which is also attached to the network via 1GB Ethernet)

- The aforementioned sharing of files among household members (the household laptops are Linux and Windows. The phones and tablets are android with one iPhone)

- A torrenting capacity

- A back-up capability to the forthcoming new drive via Rsync, and

- Some sort of GUI file manager would be good - to clean up and move around files stored on these drives

The way I figure it, I can just set up a server using Raspberry Pi OS that has:

- Access from my laptop via Putty and SSH terminal access

- Samba shares on all drives

- Transmission and Rsync installed

And then I would explore individual third party products to allow me to have web-based interface to services, so I could control various aspects of the server from my laptop.   This wouldn't be a big priority - I'd only do this because it’s easier and more elegant to control things via a webpage, than it is to do it by logging in via a SSH window.   Possibilities are:

- Transmission operated via its built-in web-based interface

- A web-based Rsync manager (Websync?), and

- A web-based file manager (Cloud Commander?)"

raspberry_pi,"New to the RPI world, considering making a Dakboard, can you guide me?","For those who don’t know, [Dakboard](https://www.dakboard.com/site) is basically a way of displaying info at home on a monitor, digitally replacing the dry/erase calendars people have in their homes. 

I have never done any real coding or worked with an RPI. Dakboard sells a CPU pre-loaded, or a microSD with the Dakboard software pre-loaded to use with a RPI. 

I don’t think I’d be using the RPI for anything other than this Dakboard idea. I do some smart home stuff,  but chose Hubitat over Home Assistant to avoid the coding.  

1) Why would I choose a RPI over their CPU, is it just cost? 
2) Which RPI would be best for me?
3) Other than the pi itself, what else would I need to purchase? Pretty sure I have a keyboard and mouse laying around somewhere. 
4) Dakboard seems to try and force you into one of their premium accounts. I don’t have an issue supporting programmers,  but for it to display our family calendar, maybe weather, scroll through family pictures, I feel like there should be a much more customizable and free option. I’ve stumbled upon MagicMirror in my research, but again limited by my lack of coding skills. 
5) lastly, any recommendation for a monitor, probably looking in the 20-30” range

Thanks, hope to join the community soon."

raspberry_pi,Ethernet speed issues across local network. Help!,"So I built a little NAS using a RPi 4 with OMV and an external usb HD. I have been troubleshooting my speeds as I've never even came close full link speeds. I'm lucky to get 35MBps on a file transfer.
Last night I decided to test my actual network and from 1 device wired into the ER-X to the RPi wired in both showing 1000mbit connections I was luck to get 300ish mbits/s. Top is over WiFi, bottom results are wired.

https://photos.app.goo.gl/5iuTPHDDkuwN5Y4b7

I was thinking maybe is was usb3.0 ethernet adapter i used on my Macbook Pro, so I tried today using iperf3 between the ER-X and the RPi. Which I'm getting the same speeds basically.

https://photos.app.goo.gl/nMGTaKKUKfg1WRNZA

So I've gathered my bottleneck is the first link between the RPi and the ER-X. It is set up as a basic router with eth0 for WAN and eth1-4 on br0. The only other config I have done is a DNAT rule to redirect all port 53 requests to my local DNS for some DNS hard coded devices. Basically stock other than that.

What am I missing here or have I screwed something up somewhere?

Shouldn't I be able to come close to saturating that link?
Thanks in advance!"

I think I understand how to power the button:

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently got my first Raspberry Pi and am struggling with setting up SMB properly.

I did find multiple topics online but those still did complain about transfer speeds that are way higher than what I'm getting over here, so I feel like I messed up somewhere.

Copying files to the Pi peaks around 80 KB/s (my main concern)

From the Pi to the PC I'm getting 6-7 MB/s

&amp;#x200B;

My setup:

* Raspberry Pi 4 2GB 
* External HDD (formatted as NTFS) connected via USB - followed some guide to boot it with fstab
* Wireless network

&amp;#x200B;

So far I'm aware that switching to LAN, directly connecting the drive and using ext4 instead of NTFS should increase the speed and I for sure will at least try the latter, considering how low it is at the moment I feel like there is even more wrong.

So - full disclaimer - I’m a total scrub when it comes to programming, but I am pretty technical - I’m a network engineer, and therefore a complete nerd.

One of my hobbies is collecting (and drinking!) hard to find Bourbons. I’m building a bar, and am trying to figure out a totally over engineered method of getting an email or push alert, when one of the extra rare bottles are moved, touched, lifted, etc etc. 

I’ve been toying around with a way to do this via IFTTT, but I’m not coming up with a “clean” way of doing this. 

Hence - a Pi. I’m thinking a valid option could be a small weight sensor that could alert if a bottle is lifted up. Are there other methods of alerting? Maybe something like a light sensor that?? A motion sensor that targets an extremely small zone???"

There are SO MANY PoE hats now.  Which one do I buy?"
raspberry_pi,"3.5"" touchscreen correct 2 corners, off on 2 other.","Posted this on rpi forums, but maybe someone on here had a similar issue they can help me with it.   

I have a 3.5"" Rpi LCD (A) V3 I ordered from AliExpress, installed on a Rpi 3A. Following instructions i installed the drivers, screen comes up  works great, but when i touch the top left corner, the mouse is on the  bottom right, yet when i touch the bottom left it's correct, and so with  top right it's also correct, but bottom right the mouse goes to the top  left. I tried to rotate screen by 90 and it reboots vertical, but still  the same issue. I tried some basic troubleshooting online, but no  resolve. I Googled a lot of people having issues with the screen being  reversed, but mine seems different because two corners are correct,  while two are not? Thank you for any help, I've been dealing with this  since Saturday."

raspberry_pi,PiVPN Issue + small trick,"  I’ve recently installed PiVPN on my Rasperry Pi 4 using Wireguard and connecting the Pi via Ethernet. The VPN works fine, but even if the port is closed or the PI is switched off, the Wireguard client will say that I’m connected successfully. That’s an issue as Wireguard is opening a non-working connection. So, if you want to know if your connection is fine, just watch at the Tx value (Tx / Rx) on the Wireguard client: If the Tx rate stays at 0 for more than 5-10 seconds, the VPN is not working, but if it does, you should see at least some bytes of data on the Tx value. This trick was tested both on Android and Windows, so it should work on all devices.

P.S.

Why does Wireguard do this? Why not just give an error?"

Get answers to these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ig2fd2/2020_aug_24_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Thinking about a Pi powered space satellite. Seeking ideas for sensors and capabilities once in orbit.,"Howdy folks, while watching the 1998 documentary ""From the Earth to the Moon"" I got the idea of building a mini-satellite powered by a Raspberry Pi. The computing power is far more capable than anything from the Apollo program so why not? Once built, I envision it going up to the edge of the atmosphere in a balloon before launching itself into orbit. So I ask the Pi people here:

What kind of sensors and capabilities should go on this thing? I already know its going to need a decent battery and possibly some solar panels, radio antenna for communication (plenty of documentation for building a Pi powered radio already), a decent camera, a couple of those rings that spin in order to change orientation and some sort of propellant to maneuver. Would GPS work up there? Barometer? Accelerometer? Gyroscope? Magnometer?

Is this just a wild idea that will never work? So many questions. The whole thing should be no bigger than a mini fridge. Thoughts anyone?"

RPi 3B

RGB Matrix HAT w/ RTC (not in use) (from Adafruit)

Solder HAT together - power thingy, HUB75 thingy, 20x2 thingy. (pics below)

Plug 20x2 into RPi 20x2 (attach the hat). HUB75 connector from hat to panel.

Panel power is plugged in to hat power lines. (Those ones your screw down to keep cable in place)

Power is connected to RPi.

Power is connected to Hat.

Following this guide: [https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi/driving-matrices](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-plus-real-time-clock-hat-for-raspberry-pi/driving-matrices)

Pi works fine when turned on. Downloaded the driver from link above. Ran installer. All good.

Go to examples folder. Run \`sudo ./demo -D0 --led-rows=16 --led-cols=32\`.

The program runs without exception, as there is output in the terminal, but no output on the RGB.

Tested it with different jumper cables and even with a different 16x32 matrix.

raspberry_pi,Raspberry pi as Desktop replacement - How does Pi 4 8GB compares to an i3 or Pentium Gold? Is the SDcard the bottleneck for Pi' s performance?,"I have a old Core2Due at home that is used for simple tasks: reading PDF, text editing, internet browsing, watching streaming movies etc. 

I'm thinking of replacing it with a Pi4 with 8GB. 

I don't find benchmarks to compare it to computers with x86 CPUs. The computers that are cheapest in my country that are an option to Pi are some Dell or HP computers with Pentium Gold or i3 9th generation. 

Is it a good idea to get a Pi for these kinds of tasks? 

I know that this question is recurrent, but most topics I've found are people using Pi 3 or Pi 4 with just 4GB.

raspberry_pi,eth0 flipping between static and dhcp IP address,"I have a pi 3b+ and had been using it with wifi only for a while. I decided to connect the wired ethernet and set a static IP address on it. I added the following to the dhcpcd.conf file:

 

`interface eth0`  
`static ip_address=192.168.10.2/24`  
`static routers=192.168.10.1`  
`static domain_name_servers=127.0.0.1`

`interface wlan0`  
`static domain_search=`  
`static ip_address=192.168.10.3/24`  
`static routers=192.168.10.1`  
`static domain_name_servers=`[`127.0.0.1`](https://127.0.0.1)

Both the eth0 and wlan0 come up successfully.  My problem is that the ip address ""seems"" to be flipping back and forth between [192.168.10.2](https://192.168.10.2) and [192.168.10.221](https://192.168.10.221) on the eth0 interface.

I say seems to be flipping as I don't see any evidence of this on the pi itself but I am using the Unifi dream machine (base model) and in the clients tab I see the IP address flip between these 2 ip addresses about every minute.

I have run ping against the [192.168.10.2](https://192.168.10.2) IP address and it never fails. However, I cannot ping the [192.168.10.221](https://192.168.10.221) IP even when it shows up in the unifi dashboard.

So I am not sure if this is a pi problem or a unifi reporting problem. What steps can I take from the pi to confirm if the eth0 interface is ever getting a dhcp address?"

raspberry_pi,"Easy backup of RPi system into small image (using rsync), updated for quad core Pi","With a 64GB sdcard, it is too big to back up as a backup.img, even after compressing it up afterwards.

I came across this project: [https://github.com/lzkelley/bkup\_rpimage](https://github.com/lzkelley/bkup_rpimage) (archived now on github - last update 16 months ago).

It is based upon [The Raspberry Pi Backup Thread](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=12079) on the raspberry pi forums.

It sets up a 8GB .img file on a USB drive, then rysncs the whole system, boot and root partions, into this, removing unnecessary files and folders ('tmp/\*\*','proc/\*\*','run/\*\*','sys/\*\*','mnt/\*\*','var/swap','home/pi/.cache/\*\*'). This image file can be restored to a new sdcard in the standard way.

The first back up takes about 20 mins on a RPi3, subsequent backups just a minute or two. This can be put in crontab to automate it.

Great! But there is an additional function (-z option) where the resulting 8GB image file is compressed into a \~2 GB .gz file for storage. Even better! But...

This was written for a single core RPi in around 2014 and the compression takes about 30 mins on 1 cpu core. However, a simple search-and-replace operation on the [bkup\_rpimage.sh](https://github.com/lzkelley/bkup_rpimage/blob/master/bkup_rpimage.sh) file to replace ""gzip"" with ""pigz"" (parallel gzip compressor already installed in the RPi OS) means compression takes only about 8 mins.

It is necessary to download and install the [pv](https://packages.debian.org/buster/armhf/pv/download) package as a .deb download as this seems to have been removed from the RPi OS repo at some point. It simply gives you a progress bar during the file compression operation but the script won't run unless it is installed.

This works really nicely!"

That  way, the screen says ""no signal"" when the RPI is on before the AVR.  hdmi\_group=2 with hdmi\_mode=76  also results in the same behaviour. When  deleting hdmi\_mode=xx it works, but the resolution is set to 1024 x  768. 

Without any hdmi\_group entry the raspberry boots (while AVR is on) with  1080p 60 Hz. So this should be the right resolution.

We've done our best to provide you with as much detail as possible so please read images' captions.

We're working on a raspberry pi powered dynamic weather map that utilizes an aviation sectional chart to display the flight category/conditions of various airports of our choice that have automated weather observation systems in real life. The program collects data from actual websites that publish live weather at airports and makes the airports (LEDs) light up as one of the four different colors that we use in aviation that depict existing flight conditions. For more information regarding this project (and for the tutorial we've been following) please see this link; [https://github.com/JohnMarzulli/categorical-sectional](https://github.com/JohnMarzulli/categorical-sectional) (as we believe this will give you a better idea on what we're trying to make.)

The issue we're running into is; we are unable to get the raspberry pi to talk to the LEDs strands while using the software to test run the lights. we're simply getting an error code ""key error ws2801"" and only 32 out of 100 LEDs light up when power is on however, when we run the test, there is no difference as to how many or which lights light up.  We haven't been able to get all 100 to light up and we're thinking it is a software issue as we've quadruple checked the wiring and soldering using guides.

What exactly does ""key error ws2901"" mean? Are we doing something wrong with the Pi itself and with the programming, or is this completely a hardware issue? Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.

raspberry_pi,Pi 4 RAM Thermals and the Argon Neo,"[Image reference](https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/11/pi4-vli-load.png) – When setting up the Pi 4 using the Argon Neo case, the instructions suggest you add the included thermal compound pads to both the top of the CPU (obviously) and to the top of the RAM chip. However according to the (very little) research I've done, the RAM doesn't get very warm on its own. So then given its physical proximity to the CPU, I'm not sure the RAM would really benefit from sharing a heatsink with the hottest part of the Pi, would it? It seems like if anything the bridged heatsink would act to warm the RAM while cooling the CPU. Guess it depends on the actual temp delta that I'm sort of inferring from the test photos graphics. Here's a good write up with thermal images of the board under load: [https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/thermal-testing-raspberry-pi-4/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/thermal-testing-raspberry-pi-4/)"

raspberry_pi,Best SBC / compute module for video streaming?,"Hey r/raspberry_pi  \- 

I'm interested in speccing out an SBC (single board computer) or computing module similar to a raspberry pi or a raspberry pi compute, respectively, but need the hardware to be capable of:

*  handling video calling (2 way 1080p HD video streams) without an issue RAM &amp; CPU wise 
* Wifi connectivity is a plus but the hardware needs to be capable of being expanded/integrated with a 4G/5G LTE shield
* ability to integrate with audio and video peripherals - something like an external webcam / camera

If there's a module like the Pi Compute that can be integrated into a PCB that satisfies the above requirements that you guys know of, please share - that would be a huge plus!

Also, not really sure about the industry terminology for what the Pi Compute would be called typically - a compute module? 

Thanks so much for the help guys! Really appreciate it."

When i try to run it by double-clicking it in the file explorer, nothing happens. Any help would be appreciated.

raspberry_pi,"This isn't good, is it? Solid green light without SD card. Any hope?","I just got my first raspberry pi, and it didn't go well. It worked for about 1 minute, then the screen went black. I've spent the past few hours trying to get it to work, with no work.

I've tried reformatting the SD card, followed the instructions for both NOOBS and installing Rapsbian directly onto the SD card, but nothing worked there.

I tried tweaking the display settings (in config.txt), but it had already worked for the first minute I had it plugged in, so I'm pretty sure it's wasn't those settings.

Now I'm realizing that the green light stays on even if I plug the power in without the SD card in. In fact, all I'm getting is a solid red and green light. My understanding is the green light shows whether the unit is reading the SD card.

From what I can read, this is the 'green light of death' and my first raspberry pi lasted about a minute :/

raspberry_pi,An easy way to do full disk encryption (and install multiple OSs if you want to),"Having spent, literally, days googling and messing about with various methods, I finally found a SIMPLE system for doing full-disk encrypts, and wanted to post it here in case others are doing similar searches and only finding the lengthy, complex, n00b unfriendly methods that seem to prevail in results.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect this is not new information to anyone experienced with RPi and am posting for the benefit of others, like myself, who may have an interest in what this thing does, but were not aware of it (it does not come up easily in searches for Pi Disk Encryption, for some reason)

&amp;#x200B;

**Berryboot** is a bootloader and universal operating system loader which works on Pi. It also works on other ARM systems. 

\- full-disk encryption

\- install multiple OSs to single or multiple storage

\- the bootloader provides an OS selection menu, and will download the OS(s) before installing them for you

\- install OSs to SD or USB or multiple devices

\- boot menu at starts allows OS/device selection

[https://www.berryterminal.com/doku.php/berryboot](https://www.berryterminal.com/doku.php/berryboot)

&amp;#x200B;

Why encrypt?

Basically protects device from unauthorised access. There are benefits to full disk vs user-folder encryption inasmuch as all operating system files, logs, etc are inaccessible to unauthorised parties

[more](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247707/full-disk-encryption-do-we-need-it.html#:~:text=Full%20disk%20encryption%20is%20a,the%20protection%20of%20your%20home)

&amp;#x200B;

Support

Theres a really good rundown of how to use Berryboot in the link above, so I wont provide walkthrough here. Hoping this is handy for someone out there because its so much simpler than doing the whole thing manually. 

Community support for the app is available through its [sourceforge page](https://github.com/maxnet/berryboot/issues?q=is%3Aopen)"

Get answers to these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ibqqz8/2020_aug_17_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_boot/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for a powerbank/battery backup?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/iftuzi/ups_advice_for_raspberry_pi_4/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips aka multi-tap extensions](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Live image backup of Raspberry PI?,"Hi I am trying to see if any system level live image backup software or processes could or do exist for the raspberry pi. 

I started thinking as this is a common thing now for windows servers to do a live system image full backup while the machine is running utilizing VSS and various software(Veeam, Backup exec for example). 

Does anything like this exist for the raspberry PI or linux in general?

The cloning of SD cards works ""OK"" but it requires downtime and physical access. I am also trying to change how my device works/runs so it is more of a dummy unit with all data stored somewhere else, but would be soo much easier if something like this exists."

raspberry_pi,Remote control cat feeder,"Sharing this project because it demonstrates how we can turn any sort of machine into a device that can be monitored and controlled from anywhere on the planet. And because it has a cute cat video.

I modded a regular scheduled cat feeder and turned it into a remote control cat feeder. I hooked it up with a Raspberry Pi running ROS and our bThere software. This lets me see live video of the cats and make the feeder dispense food. It's nice to see the cats and know for sure that they're ok and getting fed.

Details in my blog at : [https://blog.bthere.ai/control-your-rpi-project-from-anywhere-on-the-planet/](https://blog.bthere.ai/control-your-rpi-project-from-anywhere-on-the-planet/)

raspberry_pi,Alerting for Raspberry,"Hi there, we have recently integrated the alerting app [SIGNL4](https://www.signl4.com) with a Raspberry Pi for temperature and humidity alerting. You get the alert as app push, SMS text or voice call including duty planning, tracking and escalation.

Find out more here:

[https://www.signl4.com/blog/portfolio\_item/raspberry-pi-integration/](https://www.signl4.com/blog/portfolio_item/raspberry-pi-integration/) 

In face this can be used for all kinds of scenarios. Here are just some ideas:

* Sensor alerts, e.g. temperature, humidity, light, etc.
* IT alerting, e.g. in conjunction with  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
* IoT alerting, e.g. with [Node-RED using the SIGNL4 node](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-signl4)
* Surveillance camera with AI image recognition
* And more

I hope you find this helpful and I am looking forward to your feedback.

i need to use the pi zero as a fm transmitter. I've read, that pifmrds uses a square-wave carrier, which leads to noise on other frequencies. I've also read, that the range of the signal is quiet big and some one had a signal 4-5 blocks away from his pi. That range is far too big for my use and i don't want to annoy other people with my signal. For my project i need a range of max 2-3 meters.

So my question is, how can i regulate the range and filter the signal? Are there ready to buy filters?"

raspberry_pi,Can't access Raspberry Pi with static IP after changing routers.,"I recently setup a raspberry pi with pihole on my home network, meaning the raspberry pi has already been set with a static ip. Everything worked fine however I didn't have the foresight to remove the old static ip settings before switching routers. The problem is that the old router assigned ips using a 10.0.0.x range, and the new one sets them in the range 192.168.0.x so the raspberry pi is no longer visible on my network.

## At the moment, network situation looks like this.

Router connects to:

* Modem (via ethernet)
* Personal Computer (Windows 10) (via ethernet) with dynamic ip 192.168.0.n
* Raspberry Pi (via ethernet) with static ip 10.0.0.3

I've tried a variety of ideas online, with [this one](https://superuser.com/questions/1462129/connect-to-a-device-having-static-ip-of-10-0-0-x-on-a-192-168-1-x-network) being the most promising, but I seem to be missing some critical step since the connection still fails.

As far as I can tell, I can't set my new router to use a 10.x range.

At this point, I'd appreciate any advice on how to regain access to my raspberry pi so I can change the ip settings. Thanks"
raspberry_pi,Help with connectors on a smart lock project,"Hi Raspberry Pi community,

I've recently picked up a Raspberry Pi from a friend to turn the [pin-lock](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Defiant-Castle-Satin-Nickel-Electronic-Keypad-Deadbolt-GA7X2D01AA/207003815) in our house into a smart lock. My goal is to intercept the 'unlock' signal that is transmitted through the pin pad to the lock, and replay this stored signal on demand through a web-app. This should allow me to run a server on the raspberry pi and lock/unlock our door with HTTP requests.

So far I've discovered the 4-pin connector that connects the pin-pad to the main lock circuit. I initially thought this was a Micro JST 4-pin connector, but turns out this connector is smaller than a Micro JST, so I'm still not able to identify the name. I've looked at the manual of the pin lock and did some search online, but I couldn't find any information about the connectors they use.

[4 pin connector that connects the pin-pad to the lock](https://preview.redd.it/vp0vo17p2ui51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939f7cef8e9f881edaa2701d637cb05d7581e73d)

[The connector in the lock \(left\) is smaller than a Micro JST](https://preview.redd.it/39l8t38p2ui51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=075354af027bf578ce437b42f9e18742a2c0651b)

I think it might a [disk drive connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex_connector#Disk_drive), which means two of the pins in the middle are ground, and the two sides are 12v and 5v power supplies. However, if this is the case, I think I might have to get an external power supplier for this project, because the [Raspberry Pi GPIO](https://www.bigmessowires.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Raspberry-GPIO.jpg) does not have a 12V supply. If that's not the case, I need help finding out what each of these 4-pins are for, so I can hook them up to the GPIO ports.

Any help is much appreciated!"

raspberry_pi,Needing help! I have a raspberry pi 4 and am running lakka on a micro sd card. Yesterday it stopped working and displays weird pixelated text while saying no core.,I know it is not my pi because on a separate sd card I have raspbian and that comes up fine. Lakka for retro games was working fine just a few hours before and now its not. It looks like my screen is having a seizure when I turn it on if I can get a signal and then it says no core. I am frustrated because when I first set up lakka I had to enable force hotplug for it to even recognize an hdmi display. So wiping the card and reinstalling it is really my last option since I would prefer to not do that. The options have completely disappeared and the screen that tells me no core only showed up after turning it on several times while before that it showed the lakka pi symbol before only showing a black screen that says no signal. It was working fine I turned it off correctly so why is it all of a sudden not recognizing anything and saying no core? Honestly not sure what to do and would really appreciate any advice.

raspberry_pi,Read-write differences between USB stick and SD card - dramatic differences on Pi3,"I copied the installation from SD card (new 64 GB sandisk Ultra microSDXC) onto a good quality Kingston USB3 16GB stick using SD Card Copier.

I was expecting the USB install to be faster, even though it is plugged into a USB2 port.

But running the benchmarking program Raspberry Pi Diagnostics, both FAIL *all* tests. But the difference is remarkable:

Values are average of 3 readings, but there is not much variation.

||SD Card|USB stick|Threshold|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sequential write|9437|3073|10000|
|Random write|462|1 (!)|500|
|Random read|1060|1262|1500|

The USB boot and load is very slow - takes a minute or more. SD card is a matter of ten seconds or so.

Q1. Is it normal that all values in the table are FAIL? Even a brand new SD card (not a fake according to the f3 program)?

Q2. Is it normal that the USB stick is so bad?

I need to monitor CPU, Temperature, &amp; Disk space, and ideally have some means of getting an alert if the pi goes down (though I can probably do this with an IFTTT script on a remote machine). Ideally, I'd love to run something in Grafana but haven't found anything that works for the ARM64/Ubuntu/Pi combination."

raspberry_pi,3.3v to 5v logic level converter problems with relay.,"So I am using the raspberry pi 4b and [this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DTUAK34/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) relay breakout board. The relay board doesn't like the 3.3v from the pi's GPIO's so I have wired one of [these](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YZTW2SM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) Logic level converters to bring the 3.3v up to 5v and when testing everything works as expected and the logic leveler bring the 3.3v up to 5.0v but as soon as I wire that to the relay the 5.0v logic wire coming from the logic leveler drops to 3.0v.

Now I have heard that the logic level converter is a pull-up and the relay would be a pull down but wouldn't the circuity on the breakout board take care of this problem or no?"

raspberry_pi,Having Problems Editing Permissions For HDD Files,"Hello,

I have connected an external 2.0 TB HDD to my RPi3b via USB. I formatted the HDD on Windows 10 for NTFS, and there are 5 partitions on the volume (1 partition for each user made on Raspbian). These 5 partitions are under the directory /media/pi. 

What I am attempting to do is change the user permissions for each file based on the user. For example, the owner of the file 'USER1' will be 'USER1'. I tried doing this by typing `sudo chown USER1 /media/pi/USER1`

However, after doing `ls -l` under media/pi, I find that it hasn't changed, and the owner and group is still pi/pi. I can change the permissions for any other file, but for these partitions under /media/pi, it will not let me. 

It would be greatly appreciated if someone could give me some insight on this.

Thanks."

raspberry_pi,I've built an IOT network," Hi guys,

I’ve been working on an IOT platform for the past few months and it’s now ready for launch in an open beta. The aim is to allow makers for focus on their devices, rather than the network that connects them, and then make their device code open if they want to. I've built all the sample devices in python and have a Pi powered Meccanum rover that runs over the system that I'll be making a video about soon.

The system is built using websockets. The user adds a device on the control panel and configures the inbound and outbound rules (what commands and data can be sent to/from the device and to/from which other devices) and the data mapping, the control panel returns a pair of passwords for the device to use in the handshake, the user uses these in their device code to authenticate the connection. As the inbound and outbound rules are configured on the server, you can swap a sender device for another with different data keys and just update the mapping without touching device level code. You can also change which devices to send data to.

I’ve built a developers page ([https://openrnd.co.uk/developers](https://openrnd.co.uk/developers)) with information about how to use the system, and a link to a gitlab repo with sample device code in python. I will be making tutorials for different devices and sharing the code for them too. I have a few things in the pipeline for future features, including being able to make control panels for devices with data displays, and saving device output data directly to a database.

If you’d like to try it out the site is [https://openrnd.co.uk](https://openrnd.co.uk/) and the Beta Key at the moment is 612FF9FF6AFD7, this will change regularly so let me know if it doesn’t work, and in a few weeks I’ll remove it completely. The system isn’t free, but I’ve tried to make the price reasonable with no fixed length contract, and you can suspend your account if you want to switch devices off for a while. There is also a 14 day trial.

I know people don’t like things being advertised at them, so I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. This is a project I am passionate about and want to put my full time in to, but to do that I need to make it commercially viable. That said, if you want to use this thread to chat about how I made the system, how it works, using Raspberry Pi in IOT, or anything at least loosely related I’d be more than happy to have a chat.

Thanks for your time,  
Tom"

raspberry_pi,Trying to get my Rpi 4B working on my PVM,"Hello! The title says it: I'm absolutely stuck with what should be an easy project and it's giving me gray hair. 

I have this vintage PVM that I use for retro games. Among others, I have a MiSTer with a VGA-to-BNC cable. One day I thought it would be so cool to watch classic saturday morning cartoons on the PVM and started researching my options. I also had this HDMI-to-VGA adapter in a box from another project I did and figured that it might do the trick when combined with my Pi 4B so I did some googling and in fact found a blog post that did pretty much what I wanted to achieve ([this one](http://lofi8.com/2019/07/27/raspberry-pi-to-rbgs-video-on-sony-pvm/))

I followed that guide. I got my HDMI coming out of the Pi, into the HDMI to VGA and from there into my VGA to BNC cable where I combine H and V sync into the T-piece.

config.txt is set up like in the post. Now the weird bit: when I power on the Pi, I see the rainbow color test screen on my PVM. Then very briefly a white box with the Pi logo saying welcome or something and then the screen goes black. There is some subtle flickering going on but otherwise it looks as if the PVM is receiving an incompatible signal from the Pi. 

I tried a lot of things, none of them worked. However I change the config.txt, I get various degrees of signal during the boot (wrong settings yield no picture at all so that's ""good"") but as soon as the distro would load and show a desktop, everything stays black.

Before someone asks: I also tried the composite out and got a signal out of that after a bit of trying (the tutorials out there are mostly for older Pi models and miss the ""tv\_output\_on"" part that is specific to the 4). The issue there is that I have a high pitched loud sound on both audio channels that makes it impossible to enjoy an episode of the real ghostbusters.

I'd appreciate any help."

I am currently running a headless Raspberry Pi 4, headless means no monitor/keyboard right? I am moving to a new apartment next week, and I am trying to setup my wifi credentials ahead of the move so when I plug in my Pi's power at the destination it will auto connect.

From my searches so far online, I discovered that I must edit the wpa\_supplicant.conf file. This is what I have so far.  [https://pastebin.com/4pTuqe2P](https://pastebin.com/4pTuqe2P) 

Per the documentation on  [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md), I added my new apartment's wifi credentials to the bottom of this file. 

Note: I am currently tethering from my phone to ssh into the device in order to nano the  wpa\_supplicant.conf file while I am at the new apartment. I set the priority to the apartment wifi and then to the tether, but even after rebooting I still end up auto connecting on my tether. I also rebooted and turned off my tether, and was not successfully able to connect to the new wifi.

Does the wpa\_supplicant.conf file method only work when flashing the microSD or can I still do it viah ssh post initial setup?"

Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d6tp5x/how_you_guys_protect_your_running_raspberry_pi/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not.

raspberry_pi,Plex Server - Remuxes / 4K HDR Direct Play ?,"Hi all,

I own an LG C9 TV and have been looking into building a Plex Server for quite a while but without wanting to splash a lot of money at once I thought trying it out first on a RPI 4b first would probably be my best bet.
I only have a question though, I can direct play essentially all 4K HDR Remuxes I have on a local attach storage drive on my router to my LG C9, will this be the same case with the RPI with HDDs connected to it's USB and the RPI connected to the router through ethernet 1gbps?

Just want to make sure it will handle that. Lastly, do extra addons such as jackett, sonar, etc work well?

Many thanks!"

Basically it should have 5v in it to work properly however on my strip it only gets .05v. I took a scrap price of led strip and hooked everything up the same and it got the full 5v and it’s worked properly. No idea what’s going on here help would be appreciated.

I checked my main strip for any current problems and it is receiving all the same voltage all around when not turned on."

raspberry_pi,HX711 + threading on a Zero W = sadness?,"So I'm at work on an all-singing, all-dancing cat-monitor, which includes all sorts of fancy connections like using Bluetooth to monitor their activity trackers and load sensors on the litterbox to measure their presence and suchlike.  I'm trying to jam all of this onto a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and I've written some nice, modular code in Python 3 to route messages from sensors to various logging-and-reporting systems. I give each sensor module and logging module its own thread so that, for instance, the whole process doesn't freeze up while it's waiting on a Bluetooth report, or trying to push a log line to Google Sheets.

I use typical load sensors routed through an HX711 for weight measurement, and I did some tests using the [standard hx711 library](https://pypi.org/project/hx711/) available through pip, and it worked pretty well, modulo some wild measurements which could be removed through judicious filtering and the occasional failed weight request. I added that functionality to my established, threaded framework, and the failed-request frequency skyrocketed. This is, AFAICT, because of the extremely time-sensitive nature of signals sent to the HX711 --- requests are made by pulsing the PD\_SCK input pin to report data one bit at a time, but in addition bringing PD\_SCK high for 60 microseconds will reset the chip (gory details on the [HX711 datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/hx711_english.pdf)). The code for sending the pulses to the chip in the hx711 module actually seems prepared for this contingency --- here's the relevant code:

`start_counter = time.perf_counter() # start timer now.`  
`GPIO.output(self._pd_sck, True) # set high`  
`GPIO.output(self._pd_sck, False) # set low`  
`end_counter = time.perf_counter() # stop timer`  
`time_elapsed = float(end_counter - start_counter)`  
`# check if HX711 did not turn off...`  
`# if pd_sck pin is HIGH for 60 µs and more the HX 711 enters power down mode.`  
`if time_elapsed &gt;= 0.00006:`  
`logging.warning('setting gain and channel took more than 60µs. ''Time elapsed: {:0.8f}'.format(time_elapsed))`

And this is the failure mode I'm seeing dropping my (working) HX711 code into a fairly heavyweight, threaded program on a Pi Zero W, which is a pretty low-performance chip. The obvious problem is that all the other stuff going on in the program means that those two `GPIO.output` lines are not being executed in near enough time to each other. So, with a full diagnosis in hand, what can I do to make this actually work? Is there a less failure-prone library for handling HX711, can I farm the HX711 reading out to a more efficient, possibly non-interpreted language, or is there some way to give this thread exclusive priority when executing this particular line?"

raspberry_pi,Stereo Pi vs Arducam Stereo Hat for Depth Perception,"Hi,

I'm working on building an autonomous car and so far I have the monstrosity as seen in the picture (I'm studying CS, but extremely new to anything hardware related). I'm currently using a USB webcam to get images, but I also wanted to get depth perception using a stereo camera. I was hoping for a recommendation on what to do for that. The two solutions I found were either using the [StereoPi](https://stereopi.com/) or using the [Arducam Stereo Hat](https://www.arducam.com/product/b0195-synchronized-stereo-camera-hat-raspberry-pi/). The car is powered by a Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB Ram.

The StereoPi has a compute module inside it, so I wasn't sure how much of an issue it would be transferring over data from it to the Raspberry Pi 4B that's handling the image processing and navigation. I saw you could send information over ethernet, but I don't have a screen that works with the Pi, so I've been logging in only through SSH through an ethernet cable, which would become more difficult if the StereoPi was taking up the ethernet port.

However, the StereoPi does have the advantage that the computation is done in the compute module and wouldn't take up processing on the main 4B Pi. Additionally, the StereoPi works with non-official Raspberry Pi cameras, which is very nice because I might end up needing to swap the main Raspberry Pi for a Jetson Nano (or would at least want to keep that option open).

If anyone could advise on which solution to go with (or has a different suggestion), I would really appreciate it.

Thanks!

He'd like the handset to play a random audio file through its speaker, either automatically when the phone is picked up –or– when the user presses one of the buttons on the phone.

raspberry_pi,"No I2C devices at address, but showing up in i2cdetect","So I'm trying to connect 3 VL53L0X sensors to a raspberry pi and do some calculations with the results. I tested the sensors individually connected to a breadboard and they worked fine. I connected them all together using i2c and they worked fine again. Now I soldered them to a piece of perfboard to mount them properly. And using i2cdetect it is showing up at the address 29, but in python an error states that there is no I2C device at address 29. I've spent a long time trying to research this on Google and I haven't come across any people with the same issues, a lot of people had issues where it wasn't being detected at all, but mine is showing up but can't communicate with the program.

Before trying to just use one sensor I had all three on their perfboards and it worked fine using an Arduino (used an Arduino just to prototype quickly), when I tried connecting all three in series with wires in between them to my raspberry pi it threw an OSError: [Errno 121] Remote I/O error my research led me to believe it was an error in wiring so I removed all the wires from the perfboards (they were separated by a meter of wire) and connected them using jumper cables, same error, also still showed up using i2c detect, at this point I switched to just one sensor.

My code is just the Adafruit example code for the VL53L0X I'm just trying to get it to work. I'm at my wit's end. Thank you so much in advance for any help."

raspberry_pi,Best OS or program/method for home automation and/or home security?,"TLDR: Wondering what kind of success have people had combining Home Assistant OS on a Pi4b with a Z-Wave usb stick for home automation and security? Are there better methods? Things I should know?

The end game for me in building with Pis has always been to make a custom home security system. Nothing ultra sophisticated, a couple cameras and motion sensors, maybe pressure plates or car sensors under a gravel driveway. Ideally combined with minor home automation, certain outlets and lights being remote-controllable by smartphone.

My first plan was to use PrivateEyePi and it looked interesting but after checking the website it looks dated and seems like it hasn’t been updated in awhile. Scrapped that.

Now I’m looking closely at Home Assistant using a system of Z-wave devices communicating with a usb stick. Looks like they have cameras, outlets and Lightbulbs that run off Z-wave, and that’s kinda all I need. Is there anything I need to be aware of before purchasing these? Any unwritten extra stuff I’ll need other than a complete Pi setup, a Z-Wave stick and some devices?

I can’t really afford to buy devices and sensors and not have them work properly so I’m trying to plan the entire cost completely with no surprise extras or swaps needed."

raspberry_pi,Is the Pi Camera usually so fragile or do I have a bad batch?,"I bough a Camera v2 in March for use as a Backup-Camera for my car. The camera never worked and I put the project aside, as I thought it was a software error from me.

Now when troubleshooting, I found, that the camera was actually dead. I dont know if it arrived dead or what else might have killed it, but it wasnt recognised in any of my Pi's (0W, 3B+, 4B).

I got two new ones from an electronics shop in town and when I got home plugged them into my Pi0W and my 4B respectively. Both worked at first, but the one in my 4B died after the next reboot and is now not recognised by either my 3B or my 4B.

So now my question: How careful do I have to be with the cameras? They never got away from my desk, as they always died way before I even put them in my car. Can they not handle a sudden shutoff? Can the software (OpenAutoPro) brick the camera?

On the amazon page I found a lot of reviews with similar problems, the camera either being DOA or dying very shortly after installation. Is this a problem with amazon or are all cameras this fragile? Any alternative?

I can get a refund, but I dont want to burn through all those cameras, if I can prevent that."

So I wanna discuss or hear from you, what could I set up, or what would you recommend me. At best, if my landlord does said above, then I wanna use it as proof as well in court.

I don't know if I hit the right subreddit, but I am sure you guys are creative, and might help out a lot.

Thanks in advance! 

P.s: I have the chance to get a raspberry from work to borrow for weeks. So I would just need to buy the sensors

raspberry_pi,Inexpensive and visually appealing options for turning a Pi 4 into a laptop?,"After looking at the Pinebook Pro SBC laptop and looking at a few tear-downs, I'm a bit jealous. Are there inexpensive and visually pleasing options for turning a Raspberry Pi 4 into a laptop? I've seen a few DIY projects but they were a bit over the top in most cases. I'd like something that looks like a laptop/netbook when I'm done not like a giant Altoids tin that has a laptop in it. Gutting a DOA laptop or 3d printing parts is acceptable as long as it looks good when I'm done.

The few options I can readily find are expensive and geared towards a Pi 3 instead of a Pi 4 and all of them are out of stock."

raspberry_pi,quick questions about some components combined with the Pi Zero,"very new to all aspects of this project, but this thread is going to be about what i can and can't do and what is a possible solution to my issue.  

i have looked through reddit in an attempt to find a similar issue(s) or solutions to my problem, along with attempting to find if Pimoroni has anything to offer in their documentation of their button shim and ink pHAT.

I'm attempting to build a simple Pi Zero physical counter with buttons and an e-ink display to show what the count is.  
my list of items include:  

* a raspberry Pi Zero
* a Pimoroni button shim / [pimoroni store link](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/button-shim) / [pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/button_shim#)

i'm not worried about the power at this time, or the OS or coding how things work, as i have solutions to those issues. my issue stems from how can i technically attach both the buttons and the display to the pins of the Pi Zero.

my first possible solution was to slide the SHIM onto the pins and soldier them then if i had enough pins height i could add the display to the"

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/i39206/2020_aug_3_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_trying_to_use/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d6tp5x/how_you_guys_protect_your_running_raspberry_pi/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

raspberry_pi,Turning a hard drive on/off with an rdiff scheduled backup?,"I'm fiddling about with a raspberry pi at the moment, setting up a backup server with rdiff and scheduling it with a cron job.  

However, my external hard drive is a bit loud and I'd rather not have it on all the time. The plan is to integrate the backup with a smart plug of some sort - is there an easy way to only trigger the hard drive to come on before the backup process starts and then turn it off after the process has finished?

Would something like If This Then That integration be the way to go? Or would I just want to use a script of some sort to bake the plug integration right into the backup procedure? Or is there even a Pi-specific hardware option that would make my life easier?

Thanks in advance!"

raspberry_pi,Pi 4 + USB SSD =&gt; 100% FAIL.,"I bought one of the first 4GB Pi 4s (before they fixed the USB charging issue) and one of the first things I tried was SD boot/USB SSD root. I found that the system would lock up within a day or two and `dmesg` output indicated a problem accessing the SSD. (console was completely unresponsive but I could run `dmesg` from an ssh login from another PC and see the last messages produced before the lockup.) At that point I found no working solution and reverted to running everything from an SD card.

I've returned to that effort again with the belief that any firmware or driver issues would have been addressed by now and I should be able to get this to work. I have not succeeded. Here is what I've done.

First trying different SSDs including Crucial (M-SATA) M550, Crucial M500 and Samsung 850 EVO. I performed a secure erase on the two Crucial SSDs before testing but did not on the Samsung. No difference in results.

I tried all of my adapters including Sabrent and Orico which I had used on other PCs without difficulty or special handling. I also purchased the Eluteng adapter and Inateck\[1\] enclosure mentioned in other articles/posts that my searches have turned up. I've tried these with both UAS and USB Storage drivers. None of them work. I also tried them in an Intel based desktop and they all worked flawlessly (except IIRC, Orico.) The Intel desktop is running Debian Buster. (Apparently the Eluteng adapter I purchased is known not to work well on the Pi 4. \[2\])

Yesterday I tried some other OSs. Normally I run Raspbian on my Pis and keep them fully up to date. I installed Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 - both 32 and 64 bit variants - and tested with UAS on those. I did not look up how to disable UAS on Ubuntu.

Nothing worked. I've used both `dd` and `bonnie++` for benchmarking. `bonnie++` seems better at provoking the problem but it shows up with `dd` as well.

Looking at dmesg output, this is what I see for my most recent test. (64 bit Ubuntu.)

I would really get this to work. It seems a shame to hobble such a nice Pi 4 with just SD storage. I have Pi 3Bs booting and/or using SSDs and they run for months without any hint of a problem.

It seems that others have this working so I'm wondering what the issue is with my setup. Is there a flaw in the earliest H/W? Is my particular Pi 4 defective? (I don;t have another to test one, but hope that the 8GB model becomes available one day.) Are the folks seeing success using a different firmware? I'm using only what an `apt update`;`apt upgrade` provides.

Suggestions that move me toward a solution are most welcome.

Thanks!

I have an RFID, fingerprint, and passcode unit with a built-in relay, a magnetic reed switch, a keyed on-off switch, a remotely-controlled relay, a 20x4 character LCD, and a 12-volt alarm. I have everything somewhat working so that if the key is on and the remote relay is on, the system checks the RFID unit, and if that is okay, then the magnetic reed switch. If the reed switch closes (door opens), it will trigger another relay that will turn the 12-volt alarm on.

I also have buttons connected that will control how long the alarm will keep going after the door is shut. One button needs to make the alarm turn off as soon as the door shuts, and another needs to keep the alarm going until the rfid unit is triggered. I had it working so that one button will shut off the alarm as soon as the door closed and the other button would shut off the alarm after the door has been closed for 6 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want that 6-second button to be something like 10000 seconds so that the only way to turn the alarm off after the magnetic reed is by triggering the RFID unit. Any help?"

raspberry_pi,"Initial set up -- ""Mode Note Supported""","Just got my first Raspberry Pi (4) today. I have it set up via HDMI to fairly new Samsung television. I planned to set it up to wifi this one time, then access it via SSH from my laptop from then on.

At first, the ""install Rasbperry OS"" came up. The resolution was very strange and I couldn't see anything below asking about my language and keyboard. But it installed ok.

After that, the screen went dark. It returned to the TV's main menu with a note: ""Mode Not Supported: Resolution Not Supported: Change the resolution of the external device.""

Googling it, I see potential answers that relate to editing the Pi's config file. Unfortunately, I don't have access. I can't use my TV to see what I'm doing, and I can't use SSH because I haven't activated it yet. (Though for what it's worth, I am on WiFi).

raspberry_pi,Is there a Remote GPIO for Centralized Control from one Raspberry Pi,"Hi everyone. Haven't posted here before, but I'm hoping some of you can help me.

So, I've been tinkering with smart home projects. I've only got one Pi, the 3B+.
Whenever I end up trying to do more than one project, I find myself wishing I could control a 2nd device remotely rather than just getting another pi to control it.

My question is: Is there anything out there that when there is power supplied and the pi tells it to, could enable one of the outputs on it and power a device so that I don't have to have a pi for each project or scrap a project for a new project to use that one pi? Maybe even a super cheap alternative that can talk wirelessly with a central pi?

I've been looking at PLCs and remote output modules and was hoping maybe there's something like that for the 3B+."

PiJuicehat is something that I have thought it will help me out, however this is out of stock everywhere in my country. The next possible options that I have thought about are using power bank or purchasing UPS appliance to power it enough to safe shutdown.

What’s your guidance or opinion on this instance?

Observe that power bank based solution is the easiest one, however the continuous charging is going to take a toll on it and may last not more than a year.

Please assist me in taking the right decision. Many thanks in advance"

raspberry_pi,Why is my pi with raspbian fighting me when trying to set a static up?,"I have the latest raspbian buster img on a pi 3. With one I set up 8 months ago, I was able to set a static ip within the raspbian gui no problem.

The network I'm connecting to has a dhcp server on the 192.168.3.x range, but the pi has to reside on 192.168.4.x range connected to the same router (there are ip cameras to connect to).

Starting the pi with Ethernet or wifi connects straight away, with the pi grabbing a ip (in this case 192.168.3.60/24)

If I try set a static ip (192.168.4.46) both in either eth0 and wlan0, they do not connect.

I've tried adding static settings to /etc/dhcpcd.conf;

interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.4.46/24
static routers=192.168.4.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.4.1 8.8.8.8

This addition populates in the gui form, but it still fails to connect to the dot 4 range.

It seems that the pi wont set an ip unless it gets one from the router dhcp. I don't need this, and only want to set a static ip on a different subnet and i don't care about the DNS resolving either. All I need is this pi 3 to sucessfully have the valid address 192.168.4.46, to be able to receive traffic on that range.

I spent 6 hours today pulling what's left of my hair out today. What am I missing?"

raspberry_pi,Digital Signage displaying Webpage - How I got it working,"Hi all, 

Last year I began a project at work to display reports via digital signage (TVs) for my workplace. I looked everywhere on the internet and pieced together several 'how tos' to get this working, so I thought I'd share in case any of you are in the same boat. 

The issues I ran into were that upon closing Chromium without properly closing the window (ie when you switch the raspi power off), when the browser opened upon powering up, the 'This tab did not close properly' balloon appeared over the screen. This was obviously a big problem. 

Scope

Web page to display on TV, full screen,  from boot with no interaction, connect to WiFi and display updated information, to refresh every 180 seconds.

Instructions

Install Raspbian on Raspberry Pi. I used 3B+

Ensure chromium is installed. Set your home page to the web page you want displayed. Install 'Super Simple Auto Refresh' and set to 180 seconds (there are many of these in the extension store, this one worked at time of writing). 

Go to /home/pi/.config/chromium/Default and copy file 'Preferences'

Create folder /home/pi/chromium\_prefs/ and copy 'Preferences' into there

Go to /home/pi/ and create 'start.sh' . Copy this text into the file:

    #!/bin/bash
    cp /home/pi/chromium_prefs/Preferences /home/pi/.config/chromium/Default
    
    sleep 10
    
    chromium-browser --kiosk ""YOUR URL""

This text sets the chromium preferences to default every time the raspi reboots. This is necessary so the improper tab closure error gets removed. Obviously replace 'YOUR URL' with your webpage. 

Open autostart file (should be here:   \~/.**config**/lxsession/LXDE-pi. ) and copy this into there:

    @lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
    @pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
    @xscreensaver -no-splash
    @xset s off
    @xset -dpms
    @xset s noblank
    @sh /home/pi/start.sh
    @point-rpi

Reboot and it should work. Hope this helps."

raspberry_pi,Pi Zero (Ethernet over USB) no longer detected in device manager,"Hello, after setting up my pi zero and enabling VNC I was prompted to do the initial updates in the desktop, which demanded a reboot. 

After rebooting, I never received the audio feedback of the device reconnecting to the USB from windows, and as a result I unplugged and re-plugged it in hoping to receive that missing feedback. It never came...

I wondered what might have caused this, and my first suspect was that maybe the microSD card could have died, but putting it into an adapter showed me that it was fine and the whole boot partition is seemingly intact. Plug back in the Pi to the PC and it does not ever appear in device manager, but the green light to the Pi is on.

If anyone has an idea what might be wrong, or have some direction I should take in troubleshooting this, I would highly appreciate the input."

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 4 first time installing. Did I make mistake?,"Hello guys. I recently bought Raspberry Pi 4. So tonight I wanted to install Raspbian on my RPi. I connected it to Monitor (TV) and Everything went well, I installed it BUT after installation when I clicked restart button, there was no signal on TV. I waited 15 minutes but nothing. Then I unplugged power supply from RPi and plugged it in again and green lights blinked and suddenly I had signal on TV. 

After that I typed command on command line: sudo apt-get upgrade -y. But I had 2 errors something about packages. So I found on internet that I should type something about full upgrade, and I did that. After that installation completed I typed: sudo apt-get upgrade -y, and some text displayed and below that something like this: 0 upgraded, 0 newly ..., 0 ...... and 0 ... All 0s

My 2 questions are:
1) Did I made mistake for unplugging power supply and will it affect me in the future?
2) Is it okay to be all these zeros (0s) after command sudo apt-get upgrade -y ?

Based on this what you've read, did I do everything correct? Will I have some troubles in the future (if I did something wrong)?

Now I’ve been doing my research on this, but you guys probably know more than I do and I want a critique 

The aim is to provide a raspberry pi + additional necessary parts so that poor families can access text editing software, a browser, basic creative software (lightweight DAWs, paint etc) as well as the ability to go properly into the coding aspect of the pi if they choose to. 

It would be a prepackaged scenario so that all they’d have to do is boot it up so it’d be ready to use from the get go, all they’d need is a TV to connect it to 

I’m still in the developmental stages of the project proposal, and I’m trying to understand the feasibility of such an idea.

I foresee the near future to be very interconnected in an unprecedented way, our technology is increasing and it seems to be an industry of importance, if we help the kids now, then they will grow to be successful, so they can break the cycles of poverty

Tired of them asking me to airdrop or interrupting to put it on a hard drive. Ideally it’d have its own wifi connection, you’d connect, the drive would pop up, log in and take whatever files I dropped from a read only folder or they could drop files into a read/write folder. Minimum speed requirements would be download/upload a 2-4GB file within a minute at 25ft. Or should I just get something off the shelf? I know I can just make a shared folder on my MacBook.

𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻,"[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/hz4hsh/2020_jul_27_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_is_your/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d6tp5x/how_you_guys_protect_your_running_raspberry_pi/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,"Fuse? Relay? For quadcopter ""kill switch""","I'm building a quadcopter with an on-board Raspberry Pi.  It will be flown near large groups of people, so safety is a big concern.  The flight controller has it's own failsafe logic, but I'm thinking of adding an additional backup emergency stop capability, controlled from the Pi.

The quadcopter motors are controlled by an electronic speed controller (ESC).  Each ESC has three wires attached to each motor.  If any one of these wires is disconnected, the motor will stop.  So, my idea is to put something in-line with one ESC wire on each motor, and control that connection from the Pi's GPIO.

My question is what kind of device would be best for this.  Is there anything like a PWM-controlled fuse I could use?  Something that would keep the circuit closed unless sent a specific signal from the Pi, and then blow.  It should be as small as possible, and needs to be capable of carrying up to 10-15 A."

However, when I switch off power using either the app or the button on the plug, my Pi's red led turns on every minute or so (I didn't time it, happens every few moments) just for one short flash.

Does that mean that there is still power flowing? Can this harm the Pi in any way? Like because it gets a short moment of power, already trying to boot and then power is cut off?

Or is this normal and harmles?"

raspberry_pi,Should I regularly kill Chromium if I'm running a daily web scraping Python script with Selenium?,"I just got my first Pi and hooked it up to my router to run headless. I'm running Chromium in headless mode with Selenium on my Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb) to perform a basic web scrape and email me the results. Knowing that Chromium is usually memory-hungry, I'm wondering if it makes sense to kill the process after running the script? Or would it even make sense/is it possible to hibernate the Pi when it's not being used? I'm leaning toward no for the second since powering the device off and on repeatedly seems even more energy-intensive than just letting it run, but I'm not sure."

I tried to make the RPI 4 boot from the SSD, but I got an outcome that was unexpected, even though everything works well. 

&amp;#x200B;

RPI currently boots ONLY with the SD card and the SSD connected, which is fine as long as the SSD is the main storage device, which I think it is. What I think is happening is that the pi boots from the SD card initially and then boots from SSD. The SSD is definitely in use as when I open the file manager, the storage at the bottom right is 110gb, not 32gb from the SD card. 

I got here by changing the cmdline.txt file to use the PARTUUID of a SSD partition."

I’m at my wits end and can’t figure it out, so I’m hoping you guys can help me. I’ve used up all my google powers.. 

I have a headlead raspberry pi running raspbian (the latest version) to run pihole. That’s all that it does. It’s been running fine for months now. Two days ago, the device would suddenly get very hot a shutdown. It wouldn’t respond to ssh connections or anything. It seemed to be just off. The CPU heatspreader would be noticebily hot to the touch. So it makes sense it shut itself off out of safety right? But why the sudden temp spike?

Unplugging and plugging it back in fixed it. The temp readout in bash would still be high but drop down to around 40 degrees where it has been all this time. Pihole and the device function again, until it happens again! Sometimes within the hour, sometimes after half a day. 

I’ve tried a newer power supply, i’ve tried a clean install of the OS and Pihole, I’ve tried a different SD card, I’ve tried an entirely different raspberry pi with a clean install! Googling for what logs to check didn’t yield any results. So how do I figure out what’s happening? Is it an issue with the kernel or raspbian? I don’t see reports of pihole causing this.. 

Thanks so much for anything that can help me."

raspberry_pi,Raspbian Server running localhost Port 443 not finding URL on server,"After hours of research I couldn't find a solution to my problem. So I am working on a project for my company (I am university student). The project is about implementing our Instagram feed onto a website running on localhost. The website is running on a Raspberry Pi with Apache2. My php program working with the Instagram API works fine on other (windows)-Devices that run Apache2. However the Instagram API requires https adresses as redirect uri, and this might be a problem here I think. 

Other than that I tried everything on the raspberry:

The index.php and the other phps regarding my program are located in a subfolder ""instagram"" inside the localhost-directory which works fine when calling it in the first place via ""localhost/instagram"". Just after the API wants to redirect back to ""[https://localhost/instagram](https://localhost/instagram)"" an error page shows:

&amp;#x200B;

Not found

The requested URL /instagram was not found on this server.

&amp;#x200B;

Apache/2.4.25 (Raspbian) Server at localhost Port 443

&amp;#x200B;

The https: start of the redirected url is red marked and crossed out due to the https not having a certificate I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to point out here, that my project-team didn't build and install the raspberryPi and everything on it like Apache2. A team years before us did all this which makes it more difficult for me to follow and understand the problem. Also I'm pretty new to this as one can propably tell.

&amp;#x200B;

Can this be the fault of the redirect uri needing to be https? Or am I missing something in the Apache-Configuration?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your help

raspberry_pi,MeArm Pi Disaster: Arm Won't Move,"So, I bought the MeArm Pi kit the other day and I'm really underwhelmed. The first unit I got had a defective HAT (one of the pin had solder in it) and now this one has another odd situation where I can't tell if there's a defect or this is my fault. 

The video instructions from Kitronics ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPdbs9b5udQ&amp;feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPdbs9b5udQ&amp;feature=emb_title)) are confusing at best, but I followed them and the Ikea-like PDF instructions ( [http://learn.mearm.com/assets/mearm.pdf](http://learn.mearm.com/assets/mearm.pdf) ) and got it built. However, the left side motor (one of four) cannot move this white piece of plastic that's supposed to rotate the arm up and down (see video below). It's not a problem with the motor as I tried other servos nor is it a problem with the HAT. I think it's the flimsy design where this white plastic thingy can't fully screw into the arm (it's meant to dangle off of one of the bolts). 

Anyhow, I'm just curious if anyone here has any experience with MeArm. This is the latest version of the set, version 3, and apart from the confusing Kitronics video (which is for the Arduino version), I can't find evidence of anyone actually having built one of the version 3s online. I also can't find any support for it whatsoever.

But how does the Pi4 compare? Pi can have twice the memory and run entirely from NVME. The Pinebook has a 10000mAH for screen and computer. The Pi can have bigger or multiple batteries.  


Anyone suggest a low power monitor suggestion for the Pi?

raspberry_pi,SPI Capabilities Refuse to Work (failed loopback test),"I've been working on this for the better part of a month and I'm at the end of my rope.  I'm trying to flash a X230 like is so often done, but the chip was not recognized.  I performed a loopback test using the spidev_test tool available as part of the linux kernel.  It failed.  It also failed various python based loopback tests as well as tests based on pigpiod (sample command output below).

Using a Model 4 with 2GB RAM

I have:

- enabled SPI in the configuration settings, have confirmed spidev and bcm_2835 are running, and can see /dev/spidev0.0 and /dev/spidev0.1

- checked, probably over 100 times, that I am connecting the correct 2 pins (19 and 21)

- used a variety of metal objects and 10+ wires to confirm that there isn't a faulty wire

- ran a GPIO test ([this one](https://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Testing)), with the result being that pin9 failed but all other pins were functional.  Pin 9 isn't used for SPI flashing so I don't think this should matter

- updated all the software (running kernel 5.4.51-v71+)

- tried setting the max spi speed to a variety of values (including 1Hz) and tried changing it between all of the spi modes (the linux kernel loopback test keeps telling me the spi mode is 4 when all the resources I found online printed 0, but I really don't think this should be a problem)

- reinstalled different versions of Raspbian multiple times (admittedly I have not tried multiple sd cards, but I really don't think this is a software problem)

Output of various commands:

```
sudo ./spidev_test -D /dev/spidev0.0
spi mode: 4
bits per word: 8
max speed: 500000Hz (500KHz)

FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF
```

```
sudo pigpiod
pigs spio 0 100000 0
0
pigs spix 0 11 12 13 14 15 16
6 255 255 255 255 255 255
```

I can't find anyone else on the internet who had this many problems with the loopback test.  I can't do anything else until it gets sorted out but I'm at a loss on what to do.  Any help is greatly appreciated."

raspberry_pi,Migrating From RPI 3A+ to CM3+ Lite,"I'm migrating from the rpi-3a+ to a cm3+ lite because the product I'm making will be very small and the cm3+ is more for industrial purposes anyway. Ive decided for my case I will make a custom pcb which will utilize the CM3+ Lite while adding a few key functions. Since I will be powering it with a rechargeable battery, it will not have a USB power port. The only peripherals it will need are a ribbon cable connecter for the camera and a micro-sdhc card slot.  


There are some elements I am confused about, though. For starters, The power consumption for the rpi-3a+ is most likely different than that of the CM3+ Lite's. So my questions regarding the battery are as follows:  


* Assuming the CM3+ Lite is under heavy stress, what li-on/lipo battery would you recommend for a use time of three hours at full charge?(with lesser costing options always being preferred)
* I was originally using a [PowerBoost 500 rechargeable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1944) to charge the rpi-3a+ and the battery. Would this work for the CM3+ Lite too?
* When it comes to powering the 6 mandatory pins, how should I go about bringing a 5v charge down to their respective operating voltages? Would a simple resistor work?

Also, the previous project I worked on depended heavily on wifi. it would need to create and join access points, and be able to send/receive information to and fro. So I was also planning to integrate wifi into my pcb. Since I do not need USB, I *could* use that approach, but I hear that using a USB dongle-esque wifi system isn't very great for permanent solutions which are semi-intensive.  


There are other methods I've heard about too, such as spi and sdio wifi components, yet I have never heard of them and therefore cannot tell which I should use. My first priority is having a stable system with working components, next is most definitely cost, and last is my ability to implement. So if all of these components cost roughly the same, and perform just as well as the other does, then the module easiest to implement would be my go-to, as I am very uncomfortable with concepts of kernel hacking and such."

raspberry_pi,"FYI: There are two Chromium packages in the main repo, and there's a high chance that you're using the wrong one","So, it's no secret that Chromium has been MASSIVELY lagging behind on Raspberry Pi, compared to any other OS. The current default Chromium package from the main repo is at v72, while the latest stable version is v84

I recently discovered that there are two different Chromium packages in the main repo. We've got the default one which is: 

""chromium-browser""

Then we have:

""chromium""

The former is dead, and seem to be stuck on Chromium v72, while the latter is v83. If you're currently running ""chromium-browser"", a simple ""sudo apt install chromium"" will upgrade and replace ""chromium-browser"".

EDIT: Be sure sure to save or backup any tabs/pages or projects that are depending on Chromium. It might be lost, judging by feedback. 

If you're not sure what you're running, just try to install ""chromium"". If it's already installed, it'll say so, but if not, it'll upgrade. 

Enjoy!"

raspberry_pi,Permissions issue with GPIO and C# app,"Hello All, im hoping one of you out there has encountered this before but I am trying to create a .net core web app that interacts with the GPIO pins of my raspberry pi, and also runs on the raspberry pi.

So far I can run the web app and access the site from my laptop or the pi. I added a button to the home page that is supposed to toggle an LED that is connected to one of the pins on the GPIO.

The problem now is when I click the button I get the following exception

`System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Setting a mode to a pin requires root permissions.`

Theres some more stack trace info but thats the gist of it. I cant for the life of me figure out what to do, ive tried giving permissions to the dll im running, my web project dll, and to dotnet itself but to no avail. I used `sudo chmod 755 &lt;FILE NAME&gt;`.

I know this is possible to do but I just cant seem to get past this issue. Any help would be appreciated.

raspberry_pi,Question regarding disabling power for the RPi4B's USB stack,"Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm very new to working with ARM computers, thus I'm pretty cautious about trying out all of these things on my Raspberry Pi 4B. I've been extra careful not to do something that's irreversible. But, I feel like I've tried out everything and nothing seems to work properly.

So, I've been working on optimizing the RPi4B power-wise. One of the biggest challenges I'm facing right now is completely disabling the USB stack since I'm not planning on using it. I've been trying out solutions I found on the Raspberry Pi forum for a couple of days now and nothing seems to work.  
I've tried turning off the USB power by echoing 1-1 to \~/usb/unbind, didn't work out, and then somewhere on the Internet I read that's only a thing that would work for RPi3 and earlier models. Mostly I've been finding solutions for the earlier models.  
One thing that I also tried out was uhubctl, but even though it looked like it was working, I could still plug in my charger in the USB stack and charge my phone in it.

Over these past few days, I've read a lot of things about this topic on the Internet, where some people say that it's perfectly doable; some say that you can, but you can't disable the stack without disabling the Ethernet port (from which I'm connecting to the RPi, so I can't afford to risk it), and some even say that you can't disable power going to the USB stack, since it's all hardwired in there.

I would like to apologize for not supplying links to the sources of where I got all of this information from, I've lost track of the pages I've read so far and it's all jumbled up together for me now.

What I'd like to ask is whether or not anyone has had similar problems or issues regarding this matter and how you managed to disable power going to the USB stack.  
Thank you in advance."

 I am at wit's end. I have followed the instructions, making corrections where indicated, and I'm getting the machine to almost boot, but I'm hitting a wall. 

Upon running rpiboot as root, the following (apparently good) output occurs:

From there the Pi does the blinking light dance and goes solid. It cannot be accessed via ssh and has no HDMI or serial output. Tested on three Pi Zero Ws, boots as normal with SD card, tested with multiple HDMI devices. Initrd generated on identical hardware.

Anyone have any suggestion as to where to even start looking? I'm thinking it's the configuration, but with no feedback (or logs on the NFS) I'm not sure how to proceed. 

I'm kinda grumpy after over eight hours trying to fix this, so the Pi4 I was using as a master is powered off, but would any of the config files be helpful for troubleshooting? NFS configuration?

Thanks."

raspberry_pi,Monitoring my Fritz!Box with Prometheus and Grafana,"Hey guys!Im new to this subreddit :)A little introduction:Im Mirco from Germany, 23 years old and i like metrics.. Thats probably all you need to know :DI thought it would be fun to share with you what i've done so far with my RPI3 :)

So, recently i discovered, that Fritz!Box (AVM) implemented the TR064 ""protocol"" to share informations/metrics about the internet connection, lan stuff and other fun things to play with.You can even control your Fritz!Box over this ""API"". (like, home automation and stuff)...

So i began my search and quickly found a exporter for prometheus :D I was like, hell yeah, im going to monitor that :DCurrently it actually helps me alot, cuz i got massive problems with the ISP and my internet connection overall. (You will see why in a picture later).

The exporter i started with was:  [https://github.com/pdreker/fritzbox\_exporter](https://github.com/pdreker/fritzbox_exporter)So i started my journey with this exporter.I setted up prometheus, grafana, node\_exporter and the fb-exporter using docker (which was really simple).

The docker-compose.yml i used:

    version: '3'

services: fritzbox\_exporter: image: fritzbox\_exporter build: fritzbox\_exporter/ ports: - 8765:8765 environment: FRITZ\_HOST: 192.168.178.1 FRITZ\_USER: monitoring FRITZ\_PASS: 'monitoring'

    version: '3'
    services:
      node_exporter:
        image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter
        command: --path.rootfs=/host --web.listen-address=:9101
        restart: unless-stopped
        hostname: pi.hole
        pid: host
        volumes:
          - /:/host:ro,rslave
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
        cap_add:
          - ALL
    
      prometheus:
        image: prom/prometheus
        volumes:
          - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
        hostname: prometheus.pi.hole
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - 9090:9090
    
      grafana:
        image: grafana/grafana
        hostname: grafana.pi.hole
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - 3000:3000
        volumes:
          - ./grafana:/var/lib/grafana
          - ./grafana.ini:/etc/grafana/grafana.ini
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro

The prometheus.yaml is nothing special, just those two exporters :) \[i can explain more if requested\].

&amp;#x200B;

After all of this, i finally came up with a dashboard:

[Grafana Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/qec1x8gb1oc51.png?width=1875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e3c2ecf022503549bbacc136281fd5212856cd6)

&amp;#x200B;

Hope u like it :)I can share the dashboard if you guys want (its not that bad to create)..

&amp;#x200B;

A little hint: I modified the exporter to support multiple Fritz!Box's - because i got 2 :P[https://github.com/SeaLife/fritzbox\_exporter](https://github.com/SeaLife/fritzbox_exporter)

raspberry_pi,Smart Mirror (Work in progress),
raspberry_pi,Introducing gpguio - A GUI application to create python scripts that interact with GPIO components,"Github repo - www.github.com/arnitdo/gpguio

&amp;#x200B;

What is gpguio?

gpguio is a GUI application made using the guizero and tkinter libraries in python.

&amp;#x200B;

What does gpguio do?

In the gpguio application, the user can create and define components such as LEDs, PWM LEDs, Buttons and Sleep timers. Based on those components, the user can select what the component will do,  as well as define how other components will interact with it - All without writing a single line of code

&amp;#x200B;

Behind-the-scenes working -

Whenever the user creates / defines a component at a specific pin, the program respectively writes the python-gpio code of it to a file called [script.py](https://script.py) . The user can then run [script.py](https://script.py) on a Raspberry Pi with the said components in place.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I use it?

Get the [gpguio.py](https://gpguio.py) file from the GitHub repo (Listed at top), satisfy dependencies (python3, python3-tk and guizero) (More information on how to do that in the README).

Run the [gpguio.py](https://gpguio.py) file and mess around with it as much as you want, select Save and Quit, and voila! Your work is done!

Copy the  generated [script.py](https://script.py) file to your Raspberry Pi, run it and witness the results!

&amp;#x200B;

More features such as PiCamera, LEDGraph , LEDBoard, Buzzer and RGB LED interaction is on the way :-)"

raspberry_pi,Cheap Raspberry Pi WiFi dongle - Sky WiFi module DNUA-BS1,"Just posting this as a reference for myself and others. I struggled to get this working and if anyone else finds themselves in the same situation, this post may help.

It is possible to use the WiFi module from old Sky boxes as a WiFi dongle for your Raspberry Pi (if you don't already have WiFi connectivity built in like on RPi0, 3, 4 etc.). The module or oven the whole Sky box can be picked up for very cheap. This one had actually been thrown out, so was free!

The dongle is called DNUA-BS1 and you can see a simple pin out diagram [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/DI6PnXN).

The driver for this is ""ath6kl\_usb"" and needs to be updated each time the dongle is detected on the USB bus. You can use a bash script to set the driver, then execute that script each time the dongle is detected.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Create the bash script.  
\- Run command `nano /opt/bin/wifi_dongle_DNUA-BS1_driver.sh` as root  
\- The script should contain the following code:`#!/bin/shmodprobe ath6kl_usbecho ""27d5 0001"" &gt; /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ath6kl_usb/new_id`
2. Make the script executable.  
\- Run command `chmod +x /opt/bin/wifi_dongle_DNUA-BS1_driver.sh`.
3. Create the rule to run the script whenever the dongle is detected.  
\- Run command `nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-dongle.rules` as root  
\- The `10-dongle.rules` file should contain the following code:`SUBSYSTEMS==""usb"", ATTRS{idVendor}==""27d5"", ATTRS{idProduct}==""0001"", RUN+=""/bin/sh /opt/bin/wifi_dongle_DNUA-BS1_driver.sh""`
4. Reload the udev rules  
\- Run command `udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; udevadm trigger`  
\- Not sure if this step is necessary...
5. Reboot the Raspberry Pi
6. Verify  
\- Run command `dietpi-config`  
\- Navigate to `7 : Network Options: Adapters`  
\- You should see that the WiFi adapter is now available.

raspberry_pi,Sharing GPIO between hifiberry AMP2 &amp; Elecrow touchscreen,"I'm pretty sure I'm boned, but wanted to see if there's any options.

I've finally gotten the elecrow 5in to display Xorg and the moode audio interface (after a lot of config.txt and additional edits). But when I plug in the GPIO connector (either via an extension cable or directly) to the hifiberry amp2, I don't get any audio from the speakers, nor does the touchscreen function. When it's not connected, I do get audio.

According to Hifiberry's [site](https://www.hifiberry.com/docs/hardware/gpio-usage-of-hifiberry-boards/), 

GPIO2-3 (pins 3 and 5) are used by our products for configuration. If  you are experienced with I2C, you might add other slave devices. If you a  a novice, we don’t recommend this at all.  
GPIOs 18-21 (pins 12, 35, 38 and 40) are used for the sound interface. You can’t use these for any other purpose.  
GPIO4 is used to control the MUTE function of the power stage. Pulling it to low will mute the output.

and Elecrow's [site](https://elecrow.com/wiki/index.php?title=HDMI_Interface_5_Inch_800x480_TFT_Display),

[https://elecrow.com/wiki/index.php?title=HDMI\_Interface\_5\_Inch\_800x480\_TFT\_Display](https://elecrow.com/wiki/index.php?title=HDMI_Interface_5_Inch_800x480_TFT_Display)

It looks like display is trying to use the same pins that the amp is trying to use. And it doesn't look like this display supports USB touch panel.

There's no way I can get the two of these to work in harmony is there?"

I came here as my last chance to try and solve this issue I have with ""Waveshare IR-CUT camera (B)"", which is I cant switch working mode from normal to night vision. 
I have it hooked up to pi 4B (2GB), running octoprint (3D printer setup, obviously).
Camera is connected via flex cable, and works otherwise perfectly. Image is clear and Sharp, IR diodes visibly shine when photoreceptors are covered, but it never switches the camera to night vision mode, no mattrr what I try. 
First thing I tried was, following the wiki, insert line ""disable_camera_led=1"" into config.txt, restarted of course (even leaving  pi few minutes off the grid power, to ensure clean RAM), but nothing. Then I tried hooking it up to GPIO 3.3V pin, but again no change. Then, when I accidentally dropped it during installation, it switched to night mode and kept it even during full light in the room. This reverted back to normal mode after restart, I wasn't able to reproduce the switch event since.
I'm really hopeless what to try next, if anyone ever had similar issue, please advice.

I used the box, a Raspberry Pi 3B+, a 7"" LCD, 2 cheap SNES style USB controllers, a Bluetooth keyboard a set of cheap laptop speakers, a portable battery charger and a good amount of foam, glue, Velcro and magnets.

The kids love it and yes, a Nintendo Switch is significantly more compact, but I just have a thing for Rube Goldberg over-engineered gadgets. Plus, it looks like decor in the home the rest of the time.

Next step... Solar power. Bring on the Apocalypse!

I could not find any ready to go solutions for this, so i made this. This is a tool you can host on a node or your local PC (preferably linux based) and keep track of all your nodes, their online status etc. You can backup a node and restore the backup to any other node in the inventory, so reinstalling the whole cluster is as easy as few clicks.

Get answers to these and other questions! 𝑳𝑶𝑶𝑲 𝑯𝑬𝑹𝑬 𝑭𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑻","[Link to last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/hqq0xj/2020_jul_13_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_trying_to/)

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
2. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
3. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
4. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
8. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
9. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
10. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
11. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
12. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d6tp5x/how_you_guys_protect_your_running_raspberry_pi/)
13. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
14. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
15. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
16. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
17. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
18. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
19. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
20. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,Easiest Raspberry Pi Portable Media Server,"I've been searching for a while to find a way to use my Raspberry Pi as a portable media server so I can let my kids watch their movies in the car using their tablets. I found several tutorials that were complicated, a bit outdated, and didn't actually work. In the comment section of one of the tutorials, someone mentioned that they did it with LibreELEC. After a bit of googling and testing, I found that this method is by far the easiest way to do it, and works like a charm. 
1. Buy a USB-portable battery (~$20).
2. Install Libre-ELEC on an SD card.
3. Format a USB stick/drive as NFTS and put on a bunch of videos.
4. Plug in the USB stick (or drive) and insert the SD card containing Libre-ELEC OS.
5. Boot.
6. Connect to network (either wired or wifi).
7. Scrape the content from the USB-drive in Kodi and add to the appropriate section (Movies).
8. Go to Settings -&gt; Libre-ELEC
9. Then once in that section, mouse over Network. Then Enable “tethered” Wireless Access Point.
You will then see the SSID name (LibreELEC-AP) and the Passphrase. You can of course change the password it to something more secure to connect to. 
10. Search for the connection under your device's wifi settings, tap it and when prompted, enter the Passphrase. It should connect.
11. Use an app such as VLC to find and stream your videos to your devices."

raspberry_pi,Input delay on Steam Link on Raspberry Pi?,"Hey guys, I’ve got Steam Link installed on a Raspberry Pi setup on my living room TV, and I’m getting a bit of input lag. Nothing too big, but more than enough to get in the way of playing most action games. I’d like to reduce this lag as much as possible. Here are the specifications of my setup:

\- Raspberry Pi 3B+

\- Steam Link was installed on the standard Raspberry PI OS

\- Both the Pi and the gaming PC are connected to the same router via Ethernet cable, with stable connection up to 95Mb/s

\- The controlled plugged in the Pi is a USB wired Xbox One controller.

I am positive that the delay is being inserted through the Pi, and not other parts of the setup. Here is the thought process that got me to that assumption:

\- I also play with Steam Remote play on my regular laptop connected via 2.4GHz Wi-fi. The connection drops very often but there is no noticeable input delay. Therefore, I conclude that delay is not intricate to remote play.

\- I figured that a lot of TVs can insert lag to gaming, so I tried swapping the TV to my gaming monitor and using other controllers, to no avail. 

If my assumptions are correct, the delay is being generated on the PI or it’s software. If anyone could provide a fix or tips that might reduce this lag, I’d be grateful."

raspberry_pi,Oxidized AV connector on Pi 3 B+ - is it common?,"Hi,

recently, i have noticed that the metal shell of my Pi's AV connector is starting to discolor. I've read online that it is a normal chemical reaction with the silver coating on it, resulting in a layer of silver sulfide (same process known as silver tarnishing) forming.

[https://i.imgur.com/ePUj4eH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ePUj4eH.jpg)

Is this common? I believe for this to occur, you need some amount of sulfur in the air and i don't live near an area that might contain high concentrations of it, not near a contaminated area for sure. Also, why the ""problem"" is isolated to this metal shell only, if all the shells of the other connectors are also silver coated? Could this result over time in a failure of the connector or the pins inside are actually gold plated and immune to this?"

It has been about a year since I [originally posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/b2nra2/storage_benchmarking_tool_looking_for_feedback/) about my [Raspberry Pi Storage Benchmark tool](https://storage.jamesachambers.com/).  One year later we have over 20,000 submissions from people all over the world!

I wanted to share some basic results here:

Top 8 Fastest Devices

[Top 8 Devices Overall](https://preview.redd.it/gwfz0inemib51.png?width=1159&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6cad223d54930fd6ae900170abfe06114e46080)

I thought the charts would be dominated purely by M.2 NVME drives but it turns out people are using a pretty wide variety of storage.  #8 is actually a mSATA SSD and there are several USB portable variants in the top 8!

Top 5 Secure Digital SD / MicroSD Cards

[Top 5 SD Cards](https://preview.redd.it/tnaifxy8oib51.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365a4ef75891602964dcc57b26b10f277932e128)

SanDisk absolutely dominated this category with 3 of the top 5 spots.  The #1 and #2 spots are both the A1 and A2 variants of the SanDisk Extreme!

I included more data in my [writeup here](https://jamesachambers.com/2020s-fastest-raspberry-pi-4-storage-sd-ssd-benchmarks/) but wanted to keep it short and to the point for reddit.  

Thanks to everyone from here that came and took the benchmark originally (especially when it had just started)!"

So I bought a Pi 4. Followed all the steps to get it transformed into a nice little plex box with an external hard drive. 

I also followed the steps to set it up as a NAS for my MacBook with AFP using netatalk. I can connect to my pi with the MacBook including the external hdd. All great. 

The issue that I am having is that if I wanted to add more media to my pi in a folder, it says I don’t have permissions to do that. If I just copy a file, it works no problem. What permissions do I need to change to make a folder from my MacBook?

Thanks!!"

raspberry_pi,Android TV or Kodi for streaming on a Pi 4,"I've seen posts similar to this, but most of them were fairly old and from when the Pi 4 was new. I'm thinking of setting up a Pi 4 for video streaming. Because I'm streaming and I don't have much downloaded media, I'm trying to decide between Kodi and Android TV. 

Are there still issues with either of these on the Pi 4, and would either setup be able to handle 4k video at 24/30/60 fps over ethernet consistently? I have a good internet connection, so I'm only concerned about the Pi hardware and software. I had read that Android TV devices in my price range couldn't handle 4k streaming well, so I'm hoping the Pi could. 

As a side note, would the 8gb model have significantly better performance for this? If the 4gb is all it needs for video, I can stick with that. 

Thanks for your advice!"

Monitor is showing white screen. The first driver appears on my laptop as a second screen. The second driver doesn’t do anything. 

I have no confirmation that the screen works. A coworker found the laptop in a dumpster and asked if I could get it going for him but the power input on the laptop was broken so he told me to what I wanted with it.

But in trying to do something else with my camera, I ended up turning on the desktop version of my Raspberry Pi via SSH and can load it up like it's just a regular ol' Raspberry Pi with the OS on it.  However, it has none of the programs like Thonny, Chromium, etc.  It's VERY bare bones.  

So my question is: how do I update/upgrade my OS so it comes with all the features of Raspberry Pi OS without having to reflash the SD card manually (and thereby, I'm assuming, getting rid of Octoprint)?

When i added second drive, and followed the same steps(used a different folder under /mnt directory) i could only access the first hard disk and on further troubleshooting, i found out that the second drive doesn't get mounted at boot and i have to do it manually.

After manually mounting, it works as perfectly as i wanted it to.

We have teachers that might be using small rooms for planning/recording lessons. It was brought up that we'd have to use a checklist and have the person ""sign-in"" to the room so if someone gets sick we know where they've been. I was thinking of somehow utilizing a Raspberry Pi to create a small box that sits outside the room that a person can scan their ID (barcode) to contactlessly sign in to the room. The resulting scan could then be sent to a Google Spreadsheet so we know where they've been. 

Now I have almost zero experience with the Pi but willing to learn. Could such a device be made? I imagine a box with a Pi, small LCD to show occupied/not plus an LED light green or red to show the room is occupied. We would need to somehow incorporate a bardcode scanner so our IDs could be easily scanned, and also wirelessly send the information to a data repo of some sort.

The goal is to be batteries-included for as many of the most common Pi use cases as possible, including documentation, and to do it reliably, even if it's a bit slow.    


The other goal is to use a read-only root, and have a special NTFS /sketch partition with everything application-specific, so all you need to do to deploy is copy some files over, and maybe install one or two things.  


I can't say it's fast to boot at the moment(I have a plan to fix that!), but the batteries included part seems to work. Things like Node Red,GIMP,  Ardour, Calibre, Deluge, the Falstad circuit sim, and the Arduino IDE come preinstalled, so you might not be able to do anything particularly fast, but you'll be able to do it offline, and it's preconfigured to run a Chrome kiosk pointed at Apache2.  
It's actually fairly usable once it boots, about the same as an old spinning disk windows machine, but it's definitely not as fast as I'd like it to be.

Even with all this, there's still a 1.4GB ""sketch"" NTFS partition(It comes half full of assorted content that can be deleted if needed), and around a gig free on the root, because BTRFS is apparently surprisingly good at compression.

  
See the Github for a torrent link!  And note that this is totally alpha quality!

Just picked up the new HQ camera module, and am currently on the hunt for a lens or two. But, I've encountered some confusion, but it might be nothing. 

While looking at lenses, some, including the ones from RPI foundation, have an MP listing on them i.e. 3mp, 5mp, etc. The sensor is 12mp. Will using these lenses reduce the amount of data that can be captured? Or is this just something that applies for sensors and units in the CCTV world? 

Thanks for any information and help."

You can find it [at my Github Repository.](https://github.com/karunikachoo/Motioneye-RPi-RTSP-Hub)

&amp;#x200B;

It features:  


* Multiple user accounts (motioneye only supports one admin and one user)
   * Individual assignment of cameras and roles so that only some people can see certain cameras.
* Re-streaming of local streams without exposing those devices to the internet. 
   * Does not expose your RTSP username/password to users. They only receive base-64 encoded images.
   * Blackout mode (replays the last frame) if you need some privacy.
* Extensive logging of user actions
   * Slack Webhooks integration
   * Local logging
* Pretend to be the voice of god and talk through the web client to the raspberry pi.

&amp;#x200B;

raspberry_pi,WiFi is currently blocked by rfkill on fresh install even with wpa_suplicant.conf,"Issue: On fresh installs of Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit), 2020-05-27 release, Wifi isn't working until I connect either through ethernet or a console cable.

When I do manage to connect the issue seems to be `Wi-Fi is currently blocked by rfkill.`

Before you point to it, I've read the [official headless docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) and I am including the `wpa_suplicant.conf` file with both a country code and my wifi information.

I've tried this with 2 Verizon FiOS networks and even with my iPhone hotspot.

A Pi 3/4 isn't too big a deal to connect to Ethernet, but the Pi Zero W is a bit tricky to even hook up to a console cable.

Is this something I need to report as a bug or is the documentation missing something?

Thanks!"

raspberry_pi,"Looking to setup a 2-3 wireless camera system with Pi's, but have a few questions.","So I currently use a Pi Zero W for wireless PiHole function. I do know enough about Linux to get my way through it with some google help. At the moment, I am wanting to setup a 2-3 camera home security system to have a camera at my front door, my garage door as well as my living room. From my research so far, I know I need a 'base' station, which can be a higher powered Raspberry Pi like a Pi 4, but when it comes to the Wireless devices with a camera, where should I start? I don't want to buy 2-3 Pi's that are going to be WAY over powered, because that will hinder my build due to pricing.

Which Pi devices allow for the HD Camera Attachment to be installed? Is there something I am missing that I should make sure to read into before I start purchasing? Would Raspbien be an alright operating system to run the camera software? Is there a specific software or Operating System I should read into that is SPECIALLY for camera recording?

Currently I have a single USB Webcam attached to my PC through a USB cord using ContaCam to keep recordings. It works great and I've been using it for close to 5 years, but I think it's time to upgrade and setup a real camera system."

raspberry_pi,Can't get screen on/off toggle working on GamePi20/RasPI OS,"I purchased a [Waveshare GamePi20](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/GamePi20) two weeks ago, but purchased it for use with Raspberry Pi OS rather than a mini game device. It has a battery and screen and all the buttons one might need.

I got as far as getting the [video to work](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/GamePi20#Method_2:_Install_driver), but that is as far as I got. I followed the install instructions, but can't get the buttons to do anything (possible because was intended for RetroPie?).

I just wanted to get the top right shoulder button to toggle the screen on and off.

I see that there is a [driver](https://github.com/waveshare/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi) to get the buttons to work if you're using RetroPie.

Is there a script or instruction that anyone knows of that gets these buttons working on Raspberry Pi OS?

I have been banging my head against the wall for a week on this, and any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I had been thinking of having a counter variable that would determine how many times the code would run, but since it gets turned on and off, the variable would lose its previous count and start from 0. Then I thought of creating a .txt file that contained the counter variable, and every time the while loop repeats, it will re-write the new count, but the problem I am facing is whenever the code stops soon after the file gets opened, then the counter get erased."

raspberry_pi,Questions about working with Magic Mirror,"Hi there,
As someone who is inexperienced with raspberry pi and magic mirror, I have already ran into a few problems with installation. Based on my research online, I found the primary way to install magic mirror was to run the list of commands on the installation and usage section of the documentation. After working with it for a little while, I found 2 problems: the pi would go to sleep periodically and the mirror software would have to be manually started, which is less than ideal for a mirror. Upon researching both of these problems, I found that others that have used magic mirror used a different command to install it which fixed both of these problems. The command (which I found was “curl -sL https://magicmirror.builders/raspberry.sh | bash”) did not work, and I was given the error “bash: line 1: No: command not found” frustrated, I continued to look online and found a command in a YouTube video dated last year that was longer and also conveniently placed on the now updated homepage for magic mirror. I feel that I have exhausted all my options in terms of looking online and any help I may receive would be greatly appreciated. I understand I may lack the vocabulary to describe my problems in detail, but I am more than happy to answer any questions that arise from my phrasing or otherwise. 

Thanks!"

raspberry_pi,Immediately detect BLE module wake with Pi?,"***Description***  
My ultimate plan is to create a coin cell battery powered BT switch (push button) which sends data for my RPi. For that purpose I have bought a nrf52832 based BLE module and successfully programmed it. Since I would like to make it work from a coin cell, the module is in sleep mode almost all the time, and I can wake it via a hardware interrupt (push button). My biggest problem is **how to immediately detect the wake of the BLE module** or **how to receive a message from the module instantaneously** on the Pi?

***What did I achieve so far?***  
Currently when I power up my module, it starts to advertise itself. In this state I can connect to it with a **node-red-contrib-generic-ble** node in Node-RED. If the Pi connects to the module, it goes to sleep mode. Then if I press the push button, it wakes up and waits for a bit (1 sec) before going back to deep sleep. Meanwhile with an Inject node I start to read data from a sample characteristic every 0.5 seconds. This is the ""presence detection"" part. If the module is on, I can read a simple ""1"" value from the characteristic, otherwise I get a timeout (""Nothing to read"") message from the generic-ble node because it cannot connect to it (obviously). The ""1"" value is an example of distinguish a separate second button later, which will set a ""2"" value or so, if it is pushed.

***Improvements***  
Basically this solution works, but I don't feel this continuous pinging is the correct way of doing this (and getting 2 warning logs every second). Maybe somehow notify the Pi if the module is on? I need immediately detection (&lt;1sec) and I don't want a simple presence detection, but also reading a characteristic (or other variable) value e.g. if I want to distinct two or more buttons. Although I achieved this in Node-RED, I'm open to other tools as well.

Have you got any ideas for a solution?  
Thank you for your help!"

The plan is to have speakers in 4 different rooms, wired up to a central hub in the living room, which will be near the TV. Ideally I would like to be able to simultaneously play different audio in each room, and have this all controllable via an app. The TV would also be connected to a Pi and be used as a media centre. 

To me it seems i would need a Pi / amp card for each enpoint (room), connected to a Pi that would be the controller, and also control the TV media centre. I've already got the wires in place so the speakers dont have to be wireless. But the system should be controllable wirelessly. 

It's a bit of a daunting project but i feel like its do-able. Any thoughts on this would be great!"

raspberry_pi,Scan QR To Transfer via Bluetooth or ?,"I need to find a way to transfer files (small images &amp; csv data) from a Raspberry Pi to an Android phone/tablet where no internet enabled WiFi network exists.

The solution needs to be as passive as possible, in a perfect world one of the users would walk in proximity for a short period of time and the data would transfer the files.

I have looked at Bluetooth 5 Advertising data but not sure if you can send images that way?

I am probably overthinking this but it needs to be as simple and user friendly as possible.

Ideas? Thoughts? Things to look into?

1. I bought a ""T.V53.03 Universal LCD LED TV Controller Driver Board"" from china which probably wont work for the size/connector i'm looking to do but it can possibly help me in the right direction. 
2. Shit ton of google,  
I found some posts on the rasperry pi forum where they were looking into making their own adapters for the rasperry pi unsure if anyone actually made it work from there.

I am in the process of building a dungeons and dragons digital table with a large 40+"" 4k panel from a tv embedded under acrylic in a wooden enclosure.

I've been picking up every broken panel-intact tv i can find off facebook and my apartment is soon going to be full. I have a Rasperry pi, Arduino and a rudimentary knowledge of etching my own pcb board's(Never done smd, chips or designed a pcb). I'm mostly a software developer but dabble in the physical as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason what i'm trying to achieve seems unexplored territory, There must be a show-stopper or a reason behind that because off the top of my head i can think of a lot of reasons why you would want to hook up a tv panel directly to a rpi project(Not to mention 40+"" purpose built embedded displays are very expensive(hell of a lot more than 0$)

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about getting a edp to dp cable and an active hdmi to dp adapter and hooking the rpi's hdmi to that unholy adapter hell. But that's too stupidly simple to just work like that.

I don't always know the WiFi or network config for where I'm going.  Sure, you can change files on your SD Card to configure things for WiFi or connect to a laptop via VNC (if you know about access point configs or know the network ahead of time).  A GREAT tool I've added to my toolbox is an inexpensive video encoder - also known as an HDMI Video Capture USB Device.  I picked up 2, at different times, off eBay for about $15/each.  They are very small and light - about 2"" x 1"". I was prompted to write this as I saw an Adafruit Tweet that mentioned their (new) product, ""USB 2.0 to HDMI Video Capture Adapter.""  A good deal at $20 with HDMI cable. All you do is plug your video-out from an R-Pi into the HDMI input and plug-in the adapter to a USB port.  It then acts like a webcam in that you can use apps to view the R-Pi display on Mac, PC or Linux laptop (or desktop).  This is an awesome, easy way to view video to focus a camera or preview an image or video stream - without stutter or dropped frames - that you get using VNC."

Already tried posting and it got removed for ""didn't do research"". If that's still the case and whatever mod flags this as that again, could you maybe provide some help on where else I could research?

I have a raspberry pi 4 running PiHole, which is set to use OpenDNS as it's upstream resolver. This part is all working fine - when the OpenVPN client isn't running on the pi. All devices on my LAN are set to use the pi as the only DNS server (192.168.1.100).

The minute I do enable the OpenVPN client on the pi, DNS is going to the VPN DNS server for some reason. Relevant configs are below.

I'd prefer if I was using OpenDNS even when the OpenVPN client is running on this pi. Everything I can see looks correct. NSLOOKUP server info from the pi below.

So what I can't figure out is why is my DNS server showing up as the VPN server IP when the VPN is connected? Even though I've added lines into the VPN client config to ignore any DNS servers they provide and use the pihole. Am I missing config lines somewhere? Is this just not possible to do? If I go to https://welcome.opendns.com from any device when the VPN is disconnected, it says I'm using it. If I go when the VPN is connected, it says I'm not using them.

raspberry_pi,setup raspberry pi 4 as a usb gadget using manjaro,"Hello,

by using the great description of https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/ I was capable of using my raspberry pi as a usb gadget before.

However I rely on ccls and some other tools which aren’t precompiled for debian buster and hence not available in raspberry os I switched to manjaro.

Since I wasn’t able to find another description I was thinking of sharing it here.

The main differences to the original descriptions are that I use ip instead of network/interfaces.d, ifup and that I don’t utilize dnsmasq. 

Due to that I think this method should be transferable to other distributions as well.

If you want to use the very ugly convenience script I used to set it up you can find it here:

https://gist.github.com/nichtsfrei/09098dbb9afa4f132159210e3c29f759

Because of the missing dnsmasq setup there is the convenience loss of having to setup the iPad IP-Address (or any other device connected to the raspberry) manually to

   10.55.0.2 

with the netmask

    255.255.255.248

Because I stole all insights and you shouldn’t just execute a weird script from a person without reputation I try to explain the main differences here as well:

Like in the original description you have to add

    dtoverlay=dwc2

into

    /boot/config.txt

And you need to load the modules

    libcomposite,dwc2

(I use modprobe instead of adding it into /etc/modules but that’s just my weird way of doing things).

If you want to use dnsmasq you can follow the original description.

I didn’t want to use a network-manager to control usb0 so I skipped directly to /root/usb.sh and changed

   ifup usb0 

to

    ip address add 10.55.0.1/29 broadcast + dev usb0
    ip link set dev usb0 up

That’s it.

I hope it spares someone a minute or two."

I know this is a common problem but I have already searched a lot about this, to no avail. My RPi 4 gets stuck on the rainbow screen and I still don't understand why. When I plug it to the official RPi4 power supply it the red LED is turned on but the green just blinks a few times and then nothing more. Here's what I've tried:  


* Change HDMI port. Nothing comes out of HDMI2;
* Try to boot with a different SD Card. Does not work;
* Use the SD card on another RPi4. It works on that Rpi;
* Use another Power Supply. Does not work;
* Turn on without SD Card. The green LED blinks 4 times, as expected.

My question is basically, is my RPi damaged? I had some hope because of the green LED blinking 4 times, but the part where i was able to boot the SD card on another RPi really worried me."

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
1. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
3. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: I found an old guide that tells me exactly how to do something, should I follow it?  
A: Yes, follow it. If you get stuck *then* come back and describe the *exact* step you are stuck on.
8. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
9. Q: Can I use a Raspberry Pi as a Minecraft Server?  
A: Yes, but it will perform terribly, even on a Pi 4.
2. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
1. Q: Would a Raspberry Pi make a good NAS? What about the 4?  
A: No models of the Raspberry Pi will perform well as a NAS.
1. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
1. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
1. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
1. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d6tp5x/how_you_guys_protect_your_running_raspberry_pi/)
1. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
1. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
4. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
1. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
1. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
1. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
1. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
1. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
1. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Following some online tutorials I tried crontabs and bashrc. Both successfully booted the game, but did so in a way that would cause the pygame to not receive any inputs. 

In the case of crontabs, when pressing keys, certain areas of the screen would flicker as if a normal terminal was updating in the background. I was able to type characters and move the cursor around, but commands did not register.

With bashrc it was the same, except the flickering would reveal a desktop instead. I was able to open menus and such in the desktop."

Will a RPI4 4GB actually boot/load faster using a thumb drive, will it be noticeable at all? I've been reading online and there seems to be conflicting views, some saying it will definitely load faster, some saying it won't make a difference, and someone on the forum claimed it would actually boot slower, who's right??

Recently I've found this bad boy: Curtis 'Portable Monitor Player' DVD8737UK

It  turns on, but I'm struggling to make it work and a regular monitor  using its 'AV IN' port connected to my raspberry pi 1 B (has an onboard  RCA plug).

Originally it comes as a twin pack: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Curtis-DVD8737UK-portable-black-player/dp/B00BPSALJQ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Curtis-DVD8737UK-portable-black-player/dp/B00BPSALJQ)

The 'Main' monitor with built in dvd player and a second screen.

As you imagine I only have the second one.

How can I connect it to my Pi ?

I've tried connecting RCA plug to my Pi and soldering directly to the AV IN - nothing happened.

Thanks in advance!!!

raspberry_pi,[Tutorial] MQTT PC Stat Monitor with any Raspberry Pi MacOS / Windows,"##**MQTT PC Stat Monitor with any Raspberry Pi MacOS / Windows**

This screen has an endless amount of possibilities. You can use it to display anything from your PC ram, your computers uptime, to displaying the number of coronavirus cases in your state. The MQTT server and Node-Red themselves have endless possibilities. I use the same MQTT server used in this tutorial to run an entire automatic plant watering system.

[Here are a few screenshots of my screen](https://imgur.com/gallery/aeLUuYq). Using Node-Red, I connected LED lights to my setup. When Coronavirus Data is displayed, the red LED flashes. When the weather is displayed the green LED flashes, and when my internet speedtest is displayed, the blue LED flashes.

In this tutorial we will use any version Raspberry Pi as a MQTT server broker that will handle data that another computer will be able to upload. This Raspberry Pi will then be able to display the data to a HDMI screen.

The instructions for setting up the Raspberry Pi and Node Red are the same for both operating systems. The only difference is how the data gets to the MQTT server. Explanations for both are seen below.

#**Initialize the Raspberry Pi**
Download the ""Raspbian Buster with desktop and recommended software"" version of Rasbian from [the official Raspberry pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
After it has download, unzip the .img file. Write the Rasbian .img file to your Raspberry Pi's SD card. I personally use [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for this. Go through all the initial setup and whatnot. 

#**Node-Red Setup**
""[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways."" We will use this to handle the MQTT messages. To install this, simply open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi and enter
`bash &lt;(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)`

#**MQTT Server Setup**
Using your Raspberry Pi terminal, type the command
`sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients`
then make sure the MQTT server starts automatically at launch with `sudo systemctl enable mosquitto`. Use `sudo systemctl status mosquitto to make sure the server is up and running.

#Node-Red 
On your Raspberry Pi, type ifconfig in terminal and write down your inet ip. Now, on any browser on your local network, type in your inet:1880. For example, mine is 192.168.4.149:1880.
This will point you at the NodeRed workspace. 

#For Mac
Download [psmqtt](https://github.com/eschava/psmqtt). This is the client that your main desktop computer will use to send the current PC information to your MQTT server.  Save it to any folder on your Mac. [You will need to use Python Package Installer (pip)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install psmqtt. To install psmqtt, open a terminal window on your Mac and type `pip install {requirements.txt}, meaning install every line in the psmqtt requirements.txt file. To start psmqtt, cd into the director you have psmqtt saved (`cd {directory}). After that, use ‘python psmqtt.py to get psmqtt running. This will have to be done every time you start your Mac and you must keep the terminal window open for it to run. There are workarounds for this.
In your Node-Red workspace, drag a MQTT IN node into your workspace, change the topic to psmqtt/{Computer Name}/{psmqtt stat}, where {psmqtt stat} is the information that your computer will be sending to your MQTT server. Click the pencil next to the 'server' line to initialize a new MQTT server. Remember, this node is running on your raspberry pi, so for the host we can just use 'localhost' and the port should be 1883. Then drag a MQTT out node into your Node-Red workspace. Use the same server as the MQTT in node, but make the 'topic' really any topic you desire. This will become your {outTopic} that you will use below.


#For Windows
For Windows we will be using [IOT Link](http://iotlink.gitlab.io). Start by downloading and installing it. To access IOT Link hit WindowsKey+R, and type %ProgramData%. You will see an IOTLink folder in here. Go into Configs and open configuration.yaml. In TCP, set hostname: to your MQTT server address mentioned previously and make sure the port is 1883. Go back to the IOT Link Folder, now go to Addons/Windows Monitor/config.yaml. This is where you’ll set your intervals, services, and units. 
In your Node-Red workspace, drag a MQTT IN node into your workspace. The 'Topic' for the MQTT node is the address that IOTLink will send the data on, those can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/iotlink/iotlink/-/wikis/Addons/Commands). Click the pencil next to the 'server' line to initialize a new MQTT server. Remember, this node is running on your raspberry pi, so for the host we can just use 'localhost' and the port should be 1883. Then drag a MQTT out node into your Node-Red workspace. Use the same server as the MQTT in node, but make the 'topic' really any topic you desire. This will become your {outTopic} that you will use below.

#Disable Raspberry Pi Screensaver 
Open a terminal window on your Pi and type sudo apt-get install xscreensaver. Once installed, go to Rpi's desktop ""Menu"" (left top corner), go to preference --&gt; screensaver.
You will see a screen saver main menu. In the mode drop-down menu, select ""disable screensaver"" then close the window. Reboot the Raspberry PI. 

#Output to the Raspberry Pi
I use xTerm on the raspberry pi to display the data in a full screen terminal. Node-Red also has a UI feature that can show charts and such. For the xTerm route, install xterm with sudo apt install xterm `sudo apt install xterm`. Then use `xterm -fa Monaco -fs 13 -bg black -fullscreen &amp;` to launch xterm, in fullscreen, with a black background, and size 13 font. When xTerm is launched, use the command `mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t “{outTopic}“`. This is the same topic used in the MQTT out node in Node-Red.

raspberry_pi,Diablo II Installation Instructions (fixed) - Pi4B,"There is a locked thread in this sub from about 7 months ago referencing a YouTube video from ETA Prime.  The video discusses how to install Diablo 2 on a pi4.  I'm posting this because I had some challenges when following the instructions, which I figured out how to work around.  Hopefully this will help someone.  Here's how I was able to get it to work:

&amp;#x200B;

**On a Windows PC:**

1. You will need version 1.13c of Diablo 2 (and expansion if desired).  I can't tell you how to get that installer.  You can't download it from Blizzard because their version comes pre-loaded at a newer version number.  Note -- You absolutely must find v1.13c.  I tried several other versions without success.  There's an installer that I found for 1.13c which doesn't require a CD which is important.
2. You will also need a product key for the base game (and a product key for the expansion if desired).  You can purchase these from Blizzard's website.
3. Run the installer for the base game.  Don't start the game after completion.
4. Run the installer for the expansion pack.  Don't start the game after completion.
5. Go to the folder where you installed it (e.g., C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Diablo II)
6. Copy all files and subfolders to a folder on your pi (e.g., /home/pi/diablo2)
7. Download the modified MESA package from the site referenced on the screen at 1:16 in ETA Prime's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PhMCxywP7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PhMCxywP7g)
8. Extract the MESA package and copy the extracted files to your pi in /home/pi/mesa
9. Download libd2game\_sa\_arm.exe.so.xz from the site referenced on the screen at 1:16 in the same youtube video from ETA Prime ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PhMCxywP7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PhMCxywP7g))
10. Extract libd2game\_sa\_arm.exe.so from the .xz file and copy to the pi's Diablo 2 directory (e.g., /home/pi/diablo2).  Google how to do this if you aren't sure.  I can't remember the exact syntax.  I extracted it using a standard command from the Linux command line but there might be a windows tool to do this too.

**Then, on your Pi4:**

1. Boot to the Raspbian GUI
2. Open the terminal and enter these commands (lines starting with $ are commands to be entered):
3. $ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
4. $ sudo apt install wine
5. $ winecfg
6. The configuration tool will open.  Set resolution to 800 x 600.
7. Open terminal and use these commands
8. $ cd /home/pi/mesa/lib/arm-linux/gnueabihf
9. ***This is where I needed to go off-script to get the installation to work.***  The MESA package  libGL.so.1 and libglapi.so.0 files did not work for me; I had to replace them with other versions contained in the MESA package.
   1. $ cp libGL.so.1 libGL.so.1.bk
   2. $ rm libGL.so.1
   3. $ cp libGL.so.1.2.0 libGL.so.1
   4. $ cp libglapi.so.0 libglapi.so.0.bk
   5. $ rm libglapi.so.0
   6. $ cp libglapi.so.0.0.0 libglapi.so.0
10. Go to the diablo2 directory (e.g., $ cd /home/pi/diablo2)
11. $ nano [script.sh](https://script.sh)
12. This will load the nano text editor.  Enter the following into the editor (without the bullet number ""1."")  This script will be used to start the modified libd2game\_sa\_arm.exe.so executable with Wine using the MESA drivers.
   1. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/pi/mesa/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/home/pi/mesa/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/dri/  GBM_DRIVERS_PATH=/home/pi/mesa/lib setarch linux32 -L wine libd2game_sa_arm.exe.so`
13. CTRL+O to save.  CTRL+X to exit the editor.Run the following command to execute the script (note the period! )
14. $ . script.sh
15. Diablo 2 should load and run.  Works great on my pi4B with 4GB RAM."

I thought it would be useful to be able to connect to my phone's wifi hotspot since the Pi is intended for mobile use.

I can connect to my phone's hotspot if the phone is in 5 Ghz mode, but not in 2.4 Ghz mode. Anyone know why this might be? It seems improbable, but I'm looking right at it. Itcs a OnePlus 6T, by the way.

To clarify, I'm fine with using the mobile hotspot in 5Ghz mode. It seems to drain a bit more battery, but no big deal. I'm just extremely confused as to why the 2.4 Ghz network doesn't work. Anyone know what might be happening?"

Don't have any thing installed or connected to the GPIOs. Randomly (happens 2-3times/day) I can't ping/ssh the rpi. I tried connecting to the monitor when the rpi is in that state and nothing shows up on the monitor. The only way to get it back is to power it down and up again. I checked the /var/log/syslog and see the below before the rpi goes into that state.

raspberry_pi,How is the manufacturing quality/precision of your Pi 4 (8GB)?,"I bought a 2 GB model a few weeks ago and got my 8 GB today. Oh boy, the precision of the PCB along the edges was horrible.

I actually had to use sanding paper, faith and my precise handyman skills to remove uneven bits from the side where the HDMI ports are and also from the opposite side, in order to fit the Pi 4 into my metal case. And yes, I could have returned it and have waited another few days for a replacement unit, but it's not an error I can't fix myself, so I just fixed the PCB. 

Honestly, for 80€, that's very bad manufacturing. So, how are your Pi 4s, especially the edges of the PCB? Thanks."

raspberry_pi,Yet another OpenVPN Client and PiHole Question,"Let me explain how this is set up first, and if what I'm trying to do will never work just tell me cause I'm losing my damn mind.


I've got the pi running the OpenVPN *client* - not server, connecting to my VPN provider. That all works fine, VPN connects no problem.

I also recently set up pihole on the same device. That is also working fine, DNS works, ad blocks work, it all works.

Here's where I am stuck. I set the pihole to use OpenDNS as it's upstream resolver, but that doesn't appear to be working.

It *does* work if I have the VPN client disable, but the second I enable the VPN client, my upstream DNS is forced to be the DNS server the VPN provides.

So here's what I'm trying to do. With the VPN client connected, I want my upstream DNS to be OpenDNS. Right now it's using the DNS server provided by the VPN client. I've messed around with

    /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    /etc/resolv.conf

I added the 'dhcp-option DNS *pihole IP*' to the VPN config. This seemed to be the recommended fix but no luck for me.


Any help would be seriously appreciated, already spent two days trying to figure this out but my google search ability is letting my down.

I'll add some command output in the comments-


TL;DR: Running OpenVPN Client and pihole on my pi 4. I want my upstream DNS to be OpenDNS, but anytime I connect the VPN client my DNS is forced to the VPN DNS server."

raspberry_pi,"Two ""identical"" RPIs: one gets global IPv6 address from router the other doesn't","Like the title says, I have two RPIs on my network that \*should\* be near identical to each other... except for their hostnames and IP addresses (MaplePi is 192.168.1.105 and MapleCake is 192.168.1.106). The other main difference is that WireGuard and OpenVPN are installed on MaplePi only.

Except for MaplePi, all other devices on my LAN successfully get a global IPv6 address (phones, laptops, desktops, etc.). MapleCake gets one no problem. But nothing I seem to do causes MaplePi to get anything other than a self-assigned ""fe80"" link-local IPv6.

Both units are RPI3+. Both units are running DietPi v6.30.0 with Linux 4.19.118-v7 (Debian Buster). All the IPv6 stuff in DietPi is turned ON.

Following is a bunch of output from both devices to help see what I'm seeing. Maybe one of you can see something I'm missing:

The system runs on an off-the-shelf RPI4 with an infrared camera at an average detection-rate of \~1FPS. The PC-Val value represents the certainty of the prey classification =&gt; prey/no\_prey certainty threshold is 0.5.

raspberry_pi,Issues Getting RPi 4 4GB + HQ Cam to Shoot 2K or 4K Video,"Hello everyone and thanks in advance for any assistance!  


I have been fighting with my RPi 2, RPi 3 and RPi 4 for years, when it comes to cameras and the rated capture resolutions. This wasn't always the RPi's fault, as some of the cameras I got weren't official RPi camera models and had compatibility bugs. I ended up just having to shoot 720p and never got 1080p to work, well, not as well as 720p was.   


So, I spent about $100 on the new RPi HQ Camera plus an Arducam 2.8-12mm Varifocal lens, with the hopes that I would finally be able to shoot 1080p and beyond. When I first used the HQ Cam, I thought I had the 2K video working (2028x1520 and 2028x1080), as it was recording in that resolution with a preview. When I went back and tried to watch the .H264 videos (in RPi or a desktop PC), the video continually smears. It looks like there is smoke blowing around, where the ""smoke"" is the video itself. I've never seen this before and I'm not even sure what to call this sort of image distortion (see night time capture)  


Below, I have included two snapshots from 2K videos shot with my HQ Cam + RPi 4 4GB. In the daytime capture, you can see how a car driving down the road causes blocking and other distortion. You'll also notice random boxes that cause distortion, look directly below the trash can (near the bottom of the frame) and you'll see it.  


[Daytime 2028x1080 \(30fps\) Raspivid capture](https://preview.redd.it/5f16qrs81p651.png?width=2028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12af2252e8a4bda6cf97aeeb6f5f00763a8aa370)

This night time shot was obviously not dialed in for night time capture. However, it clearly shows the other common distortion I see, which is image smearing so badly that is looks like smoke. This happens with any video I shoot over 1080p/60fps, playing back on any device. It's even like this after I use MP4Box to wrap the H264 into a MP4. 

[Night time 2028x1080 \(30fps\) Raspivid Capture](https://preview.redd.it/njjbul585p651.png?width=2028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c62821472c61a742da906bef194b3e97e1b55fc0)

Night-time 2028x1080 (30FPS) RaspiVid  capture

Things I have tried:  
1: New CSI cable  
2: Increased GPU memory split (tried 384 and 512)   
3: Manually set bitrate and QP. Also tried doing variable bit-rate, using -b 0 -qp 20  
4: Reinstalled Raspbian and tried a different SD card  
5: Tried using raspividYUV, but I'm not up to speed on messing with YUV output files. Would Adobe Premiere be able to deal with it?  
6: Your typical FAQ solutions, like  sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get full-upgrade   


**Questions:**  
1: Should it be possible to record video using the standard raspivid that shoots beyond 1080p and 60fps? I see a hard limit listed in a few places, but then I see people acting like they are shooting 2K and 4K video with these cameras. How?  


2: If I try to shoot the max resolution (4056x3040) at 10 FPS, I get the too many macroblocks error and it won't even try. I have seen this error so many times and I do know about the hard limit. My question is, how are we supposed to shoot 2K and 4K video, if the macroblock limit is going get exceeded? Why would an official RPi product not do what it's advertised for?    


Note: I can shoot 4K @ 10 FPS if I use raspividyuv, but I haven't yet checked to see if that is working correctly, or if it also has issues as shown above for the 2K vids.  


3: Would using Python to control the camera give me any benefits over Raspivid, besides the fact it's easier to save and edit the camera configurations?

I must say i have seen that temp/C\_F icon in the right uphead corner of my pi seen a couple of times, while i have not even tried to overclock the poor thing yet. Also, i do not have any need for this yet, but if i wanted to run more demanding games (n64), should i just skip emulating those, or is it worth the risk (overheating without a fan) ?"

Instead of an app doing all of this locally, is there something I could run on a Raspberry Pi etc, that would handle the 1 minute interval checks and update my Android phone by push notification when necessary?

raspberry_pi,Transitioning to SSD boot - are there compatability issues with m.2 to usb3?,"Hi friends

After seeing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVhYvvrGhMU) I decided it's time to make the transition to an SSD boot drive on my RPi4 4GB. Where I live the lower sized SSDs (\~120gb, m.2 and SATA) are roughly the same price. So naturally I'd want to opt for the m.2 to USB3 option as it can more optimally utilize that USB3 speed.

From what I figure the Pi will just see it as a USB boot drive and I should, theoretically, be able to follow the video's instructions but with a different drive.

What are your experiences?"

raspberry_pi,New stable firmware delivers faster reboot times and more,"With the new bootloader for the Raspberry Pi 4 moving from beta to stable I've seen a number of posts and videos covering the fact you can now boot the Raspberry Pi 4 from USB3 attached storage, eliminating the use of the unreliable SD cards. I've joined the party and completed some performance tests of my own.

Unlike other posts I've read that commented that the use of USB3 SSD didn't help boot time I noted it does help **reboot** times, in my case 10 seconds  (a reduction of around 25%). Observing the Pi boot it's clear that the bootloader takes a little bit more time to start loading the OS when using USB storage compared to the onboard micro SD card. This relatively short delay eats up a lot of the advantage of the faster storage. With a reboot, there is more time shutting down and booting where storage performance is helping that the impact of the longer bootloader period is squashed.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img a9b3rea34m651...*

As you'd expect application load times are also improved, a least for 1st load, subsequent loads are all about the same as files are loaded from the files system cache on the Pi. But it still makes the Pi feel a little snappier, for example, LibreOffice calc load time drops from 16 seconds to 7 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img fvv9jyn44m651...*

The USB3 storage devices provide both an increase in reliability and performance/usability of application on the Pi.

Where this fast storage will really help is with workloads that are significantly more storage resource-intensive than office applications or compiling a kernel, such as a heavily loaded database server, logging server or as a NAS. The most significant improvement is how much better SSD storage can handle random write. In my test my Samsung Pro Plus 32GB sd card maxed out at 318KB/s random 4k writes whereas an old USB3 flash drive managed \~3600KB/s and an old SSD hit 23230KB/s.

So if you have some an old SSD lying around the Pi might be a could place to repurpose it, if your workloads are sufficient to utilise the additional performance available.

If you're interested you can read more about my testing [here](https://www.martinrowan.co.uk/2020/06/raspberry-pi4-usb3-0-storage-performance/)."
raspberry_pi,Faster reboot times,[removed]
raspberry_pi,Looking for a UPS to keep my Zero-W alive during outages.,"Hey everyone,

I am building a wireless temperature alarm using a Raspberry Pi Zero W. I do IT at a school and I am trying to detect when the fridges or freezers start getting too warm or cold. 

For this project I need to keep the Pi plugged into a wall at all times, then switch immediately over to battery power when the freezer/fridge power dies. (Happens more often than you'd think -- we just lost $3000+ in food this summer). 

I need a UPS with the following qualities:

* Charge a battery while powering the Pi at the same time
* Immediate fail-over without killing the Pi and risking corrupted data
* 3-4 hours of battery life is desirable
* Once the power comes back on, it should resume charging. For some reason a lot of boards never accept wall power again after losing it the first time unless you unplug the battery for a few minutes.
* GPIO/UART or something to let me know that I have lost wall power so I can fire off a text message about this.

Does anyone have suggestions? I'm considering [this one](https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Raspberry-Standard-Expansion-Cellphone/dp/B01LAEX7J0/) from MakerFocus but it looks like it has the issue where after it loses power, it has to be manually reset."

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
1. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
3. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: I found an old guide that tells me exactly how to do something, should I follow it?  
A: Yes, follow it. If you get stuck *then* come back and describe the *exact* step you are stuck on.
8. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
9. Q: Can I use a Raspberry Pi as a Minecraft Server?  
A: Yes, but it will perform terribly, even on a Pi 4.
2. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
1. Q: Would a Raspberry Pi make a good NAS? What about the 4?  
A: No models of the Raspberry Pi will perform well as a NAS.
1. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
1. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
1. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
1. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d6tp5x/how_you_guys_protect_your_running_raspberry_pi/)
1. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
1. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
4. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
1. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
1. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
1. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
1. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
1. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).
1. Q: I'm trying to use the built-in composite video output that is available on the Pi 2/3/4 headphone jack, do I need a special cable?  
A. Make sure your cable is wired correctly and you are using the correct RCA plug. Composite video cables for mp3 players **will not** work, the common ground goes to the wrong pin. Camcorder cables will often work, but [red and yellow will be swapped on the Raspberry Pi](https://i.imgur.com/KOpLR7B.jpg).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not.

I am failing to set it up in a headless manner. I used the exact same procedure on Stretch, my guess is that something changed or im making a stupid mistake.

The WPA supplicant config file seems to be working, but rfkill is blocking the WiFi even though a country is set. Here is how I set it up:

```
wpa_passphrase &lt;wifi AP name&gt; &lt;wifi password&gt; | sed -e 's/#.*$//' -e '/^$/d' &gt;&gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

This results in the following file under `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`:  
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=DE
network={
        ssid=""Access Point Name""

        psk=******
}
```

On login I see the following message:  
`Wi-Fi is currently blocked by rfkill. 
Use raspi-config to set the country before use.`

Executing `sudo rfkill unblock wifi` fixes the problem. This is not a suitable solution since I need to be able to burn SD cards from preconfigured images. I build the images using (HashiCorp) Packer, then plug them into one of the raspis lying somewhere where wired connectivity is not a good option.

On previous Raspbian (Debian) versions this used to be enough. Am I supposed to do it differently now or is there a step missing?  
Should I alternatively do it with the Network Manager (I read some references regarding that)?  

One of the answers I found mentioned putting the supplicant under /boot, but I cannot find any documentation on this."

raspberry_pi,5 inch 4:3 display,"Hi guys, I recently bought an old portable crt that I have been wanting to replace with a raspberry pi and new monitor.

I wanted something that could fit exactly in the space of the old CRT but I'm struggling to find anything that is 4 by 3 ratio as everything is more 16 by 9. 

I bought a backup camera monitor which seems to work fine but again it's not the right aspect ratio. Everytime I search for a 5-inch display it's obviously too to small in height as the ratio is 16 by 9

Has anyone got any recommendations of what I could use? another alternative would be to use a 6-inch display as the bezel will cut off the rest of the display but again I'm finding it hard to find one of these and I think 7 inch will be too large"

raspberry_pi,"""Please insert disk into"" SD card not working"," Hello, I am a first time raspberry pi user. I got a raspberry pi 4 and the 7 inch screen to mess around with python on. I went to install raspbian or whatever the new OS is called on an SD card using Balena Etcher, but I started encountering problems. At first, I'm pretty sure I got the installation on my new SD card successfully. When I tried booting my pi for the first time, the green light would flash 4 times. I did some googling and was able to narrow down the problem to the SD card. I put it back in my computer to see what was up, and the drive was basically unrecognizable. When i would double click on it, it would say ""Please insert disk into"" and then the name of the drive. I tried reformatting, updating drivers, and using Etcher again. Nothing worked. I kept getting errors like the drive was non existent or something similar. I tried another SD card through Etcher which failed as soon as the etch completed. It then started functioning the same as the first card. I cant figure out how to fix this. I tried on my laptop as well as pc with and without an adapter. Both cards are 32 gbs. One was new and the other was older and I know it worked."
raspberry_pi,New to this sub. Need advice.,"First, to preface, I am an audio/video/IT installer by trade so I am very handy around technology and computers.  I just have no experience with Raspberry Pi's.

A few years ago, I purchased a custom arcade cabinet with a Raspberry Pi 3 and 10,000 plus games installed. (Retropie I believe).  A few months ago, it was giving me weird errors so I purchased another RPI3 (correct abbreviation?) and tried it out only to have the same results.  I tested the microSD card in my computer and found it was completely corrupted so I ordered another card from the seller of the arcade cabinet pre-installed with the OS and games.  Everything has worked fine until today.  Now, instead of errors, I get no HDMI output from the RPI3 at all.  My first thought was to try my previously purchased RPI3 so I swapped them out only to still have no image.  I then thought the card might yet again be the issue, but it reads fine in my PC. (Half of it anyway.  It's a 128gb only showing about 50gb but I'm assuming it's partitioned in some fashion that Windows can't read it all).

Anyway, I kinda need this thing up and running ASAP (it's for my other business), and I'm at a loss.

For education's sake, does a Raspberry Pi post similarly to a PC in that even if you don't have a hard drive (or in this case, a MicroSD card) installed, that you should still at least see something on the screen?

Also, I have tried multiple power supplies including the one that has been installed in the cabinet for years and I only get the red power light but no HDMI image on EITHER Pi. (The pre-installed one and the extra one purchased months ago)

Again, not familiar with this sub but if it's like any of the other tech subs I'm part of, there's somebody out there willing to help a noob in his time of need.  Thanks!"

raspberry_pi,{Basic Tutorial} How to harden a Raspberry Pi for self hosting,"So lately I have found myself helping quite a few people trying to setup simple self hosting like a single word press site or a Bittorent client server they can access from outside to check on.

Almost invariably they seem to be using Raspberry Pi's for their endeavor's and just as invariably their Google-fu seems to be lacking. So half as a note to self and half as a quick and dirty guide I hacked the following page together because I DIDN't want them following the similar page on the Raspberry Pi Foundation website that includes removing the Pi user since that is..problematic.

raspberry_pi,Accurately switching my HiFi on or off with Alexa using an RPi - based smart IR blaster and a cheap smart socket with energy monitoring functionality,"This isn't as cool as most of the projects on here but I thought I'd share incase anyone wants to do the same.

A few years ago I built a smart IR blaster from an old spare Pi 1B, an Energenie Pi-mote, LIRC and HA-Bridge. This gives me voice control using an Echo Dot to turn my HiFi, TV and a few other devices on and off. However, remote controls do not generally have separate on and off buttons, just a single power toggle button, so 'on' and 'off' were the same IR signal. Not the end of the world, but annoying!

I was able to determine if my smart TV was currently on or off as it is on my LAN, so I wrote a script that pinged the TV's IP address first and then sent the IR signal only if it was appropriate.

My HiFi however is not smart and is not connected to my home network, so this method obviously doesn't work. I have some devices connected to cheap smart sockets that use the Tuya Smartlife cloud and was using IFTTT to control them, recently it has stopped working as Tuya have decided IFTTT charges too much so have removed the service. This led me to find tuya-cli (https://github.com/TuyaAPI/cli), which allows you to disconnect the sockets from the cloud and control them locally.

tuya-cli also reads power usage info from sockets that have energy monitors. I hooked up my HiFi to one and was able to determine if it was powered up or in standby based on the current power consumption.

From there I was able to write a script that determines if the HiFi is on or in standby and send the IR signal only if its state needs to be changed.

The only downside is tuya-cli takes a few seconds to connect to the socket and it sometimes fails, so I had to use an until loop to keep trying until the command works, so there is always a 3-7 second delay before the IR signal is sent.

If anyone is interested in doing the same I can share my scripts on here."

raspberry_pi,Apache2 localhost keeps crashing?,"I've been hired to use a raspberry pi to create a kind of ""lobby kiosk"" in the lobby of the company I'm working for for my high school internship. On startup, the raspberry pi will display 3 items; a constantly looping video of a presentation that sums up the goals and services of the company, the weather, and a news bar. 

To accomplish this, I decided to use a locally hosted apache2 website that would be opened in kiosk mode on boot. To provide the news and weather, I used website widgets; the ones from [momentaryreview.com](https://momentaryreview.com) and [weatherwidget.io](https://weatherwidget.io), respectively, and the video was provided using &lt;video&gt; html5 tags with the source being a .mp4 file stored on the pi. To continuously update the news and weather, I set up the website to refresh every time the presentation finishes, so as to not disrupt the loop. I also have some CSS code to hide the scrollbar. Lastly, I set up a cronjob to reboot the pi every day at midnight.

This setup works fairly well, except every hour or two, the website will randomly crash, displaying the typical ""oops! we couldn't access this webpage"" error. Nothing appears in the error logs, and there isn't unusual appears in the access logs either; in addition, when you refresh the page, everything goes back to normal. Though, of course I can't have the kiosk needing to be refreshed every couple hours; it has to be running all day without any intervention. What could be causing these crashes?

Thanks in advance for any help!"

raspberry_pi,GPG Encrypted Dashcam,"Since I cannot find any encrypted cameras let alone encrypted dashcams on the market, I made this... a dashcam that pipes output through GPG before writing to disk.  Data can't be read until bringing it back to a computer with the private key.  Forgive my cardboard box case, but it worked quite well.  The scripting to put it all together and daemonize everything was a couple hundred lines.

Parts: Raspberry Pi 2 ($35) 64GB SD Card ($10) 2x Panasonic 18650 Batteries ($15) Geekworm X728 power board ($54) Adafruit Ultimate GPS ($40) Smraza OV5647 wide-angle camera ($25).  The whole project was about $130 without audio hardware (already had the pi and card).

Features: Records 720p30 wide angle video via picam, full auto on/safe off via the X728 UPS, RTC on the X728, records GPS via gpsd as both SRT (subtitles) and GPX files (also GPG encrypted).  The clips are saved on a dedicated SD card partition where you only need to add ""mykey.asc"" for GPG.

Future Improvements: 1) I never got around to getting audio hardware but picam is set up to record over USB, I guess it would be another $20 or so to find a decent USB mic.  2) I didn't solder a battery to the GPS module but it might be a better idea to use that as the RTC plus it would capture GPS faster 3) a GPS antenna might help, sometimes it took a minute or longer to capture the GPS signal 4) I'm not sure why picam can only keep up with 720p when raspivid works fine at 1080p... 5) it would be more ideal if the SRT was embedded in the MKV.

I had to return the X728 because I was having issues with it not always powering on.  The documentation and samples they had for the X728 were pretty garbage and wrong so that took some reverse engineering to figure out.   It was a difficult purchase because the X728+batteries were $70 and their \*only\* purpose is to allow the Pi to gracefully shut down when the car cuts power.

The video quality at 720p30 is also pretty bad compared to other cams you can get for half the price.  But it was a fun proof of concept.  I was also surprised that it survived several hot days in my car. Hopefully encrypted cameras make it to market eventually!

Maybe an interesting future project would be to port the scripting to a PinePhone since it already has the exact hardware needed for this project (camera, GPS, battery, etc) but much more compact.

raspberry_pi,"Unable to select ""Graphical Installation"" when trying to install in Hyper-V","I've reviewed the [Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/best-practices-for-running-linux-on-hyper-v)for using Linux images in Hyper-V. I downloaded the [Raspberry Pi Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/) image and followed these steps:

1. Grab Raspberry PI Desktop

* Download ""2020-02-12-rpd-x86-buster.iso"" from [https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/)

2. Create Virtual Machine

* Hyper-V VM
* VM: pi-hole2
* Generation: 2
* Memory: 1GB
* HD: pihole2.vhdx
* HDD: 16GB
* OS: ""2020-02-12-rpd-x86-buster.iso""

3. Configure Virtual Machine

* Disable Secure Boot
* Processors: 2
* Network: Set Static MAC Address
* Integration Services: Guest Services
* Checkpoint Type: Disabled
* Automatic Start Action: Always start

4. Start Virtual Machine

* Select Graphical Install
* ...

And that's as far as I get. I try to select Graphical Install using the Grub Loader but nothing registers. I have a mouse pointer available to me, but I can't register clicks. I have tried pressing G for Graphical, and nothing kicks in. Instead, it runs the image with no persistence, and I get to pretend to have Raspbian OS installed.

I've done this with both Generation 1 and Generation 2 (with [secure boot disabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/supported-debian-virtual-machines-on-hyper-v)) but nothing seems to enable selections.

There are [so](https://www.avoiderrors.com/how-to-install-raspbian-os-on-hyper-v/) many [tutorials](https://codeinsane.wordpress.com/2019/09/17/install-raspberry-pi-desktop-on-hyper-v/) on [how](http://baqwas.joomla.com/8-iot/19-rpi-under-hyper-v) to [do](https://sirmark.de/computer/tutorial-raspian-os-unter-hyper-v-installieren-1865.html) this [but](https://www.1ft-seabass.jp/memo/2018/03/18/windows10-hyperv-meets-raspberrypi-image-and-node-red/) each one just says ""select graphical install"", and it's just not working for me. Anyone got a solution for this? I very much hope it's something obvious and simple. :D"

raspberry_pi,Need advice for testing if GFCI has tripped.,"Some background...  
Using a PiZeroW, IFTTT, and Google Assistant I made a voice operated garage door opener.  It will notify me via e-mail and text if I have left the door open after 10pm and automatically close it.  
So I have a PiZeroW in my garage.  

The problem...  
Also in my garage is a spare refrigerator that is plugged into a power strip that is plugged into an outlet on the same circuit as a GFCI outlet. There is nothing else plugged into the power strip or either outlet. On occasion, the GFCI outlet will trip for apparently no good reason. The outlet is in a position where it is not easily seen so one doesn't notice the indicator light. This has caused an issue a time or two when we did not notice the circuit trip and our food defrosted.  
I have since plugged in a simple LED nightlight to the power strip as an easy indicator as to whether to GFCI outlet has tripped. This only works if you go into the garage and happen to notice. 

Possible solutions???  
I am trying to think of a way the PiZeroW could monitor the outlet/power strip and notify me if the circuit has tripped an lost power. The Pi and the Fridge/outlets for all intents an purposes are on opposite sides of the room.   
One way I was thinking of was to set up a webcam I have laying around to monitor the LED nightlight plugged into the power strip. This may be tricky due to varying ambient lighting conditions. The garage has windows and there are overhead lights so it would need to be able to tell if the nightlight is on on a sunny day, with the overhead lights on, and total darkness.  
I have a good amount of basic doorbell wire that I could run to the power strip. Maybe spliced to a 5v wall wart and look for the 5v at the pi.

I am a software developer so handling the coding side of things won't be an issue, just need to figure out the hardware side.

Open to hearing all thoughts and suggestions on how I might be able to solve this issue."

    0+0 records out
    0 bytes copied, 58.2416 s, 0.0 kB/s

I thought I had gotten unlucky over and over again purchasing micro SD cards.  But then I was able to write images OK from a Windows laptop.  So that led me to do some Googling, which resulted in this blog with all the answers: https://pank.eu/blog/w530-sdcard-reader-fix.html

From the link above, this is the one-time fix:

    sudo rmmod sdhci_pci
    sudo rmmod sdhci
    sudo modprobe sdhci debug_quirks2=""0x2""
    sudo modprobe sdhci_pci

And the permanant fix involves making this file:

    /etc/modprobe.d/sdhci-pci.conf

And putting this in the `/etc/modprobe.d/sdhci-pci.conf` file:

    options sdhci debug_quirks2=0x2

Hope this helps other people out and saves someone time and unnecessary returns of actually working micro SD cards."

It feels like it's running at 30hz with a 10ms delay on mouse movements, lots of stuttering, watching videos on YouTube is unbareable because of the microstutters that occur. It's all just a very low-performance experience, which doesn't seem to ring true for most peoples experience on just casual use.

Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
1. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
3. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: I found an old guide that tells me exactly how to do something, should I follow it?  
A: Yes, follow it. If you get stuck *then* come back and describe the *exact* step you are stuck on.
8. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
9. Q: Can I use a Raspberry Pi as a Minecraft Server?  
A: Yes, but it will perform terribly, even on a Pi 4.
2. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
1. Q: Would a Raspberry Pi make a good NAS? What about the 4?  
A: No models of the Raspberry Pi will perform well as a NAS.
1. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
1. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
1. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
1. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?

A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming
* /r/HomeNetworking
* /r/LearnPython
* /r/LinuxQuestions
* /r/RetroPie

Asking in a forum more specific to your question will likely *get better answers*!

raspberry_pi,lower power music and video library organization,"Since the early 2000s Ive been building a large library of music, movies and TV shows which I have been very badly keeping organized. Would a raspberrypi4 running software such a MusicBrainz Picard and Handbrake be worth the investment to resolve the issue? Its not important that the transcoding and tagging gets done quickly, it just needs to get done efficiently. I also just want to play around with a raspberrypi and I figured that this would be a nice little project for it to deal with first."

Hi, this is a little how-to guide for the Pi-hole e-inkt stats screen. I tried to describe everything with a lot of details, so even beginners will be able to reproduce what I made! Anyways, please let me know what you think, feedback is always welcome!

I found an interesting Github page repository from [BillyBunn](https://github.com/BillyBunn), it is called [pi-hole](https://github.com/BillyBunn/pi-hole). (Don't confuse it with **the original** [**Pi-hole**](https://github.com/pi-hole) repository)

Because the project of BillyBunn had some bugs that wasn't fixed. I decided to fork the repo and focussed on fixing the few bugs. Make the graph working and add some more configuration options.

If you are interested in the full guide I will post a link under here, and please let me know what you think! Suggestions are always welcome :)

raspberry_pi,Low SFTP transfer speeds on Pi 4,"Hi everyone!

I've got my RPi 4 a few weeks ago and I love it. There is only one thing which has been bothering me for a while. While transfering files using SFTP, using Bitvise client, I'm only getting around 20MB/s. 

My Raspberry Pi is running Manjaro arm64 from a Crucial BX500 SSD over USB. Using dd my reads and writes are around 200MB/s so disk performance should not be the issue.

On both, the RPi and on my windows PC the Ethernet speed is showing 1Gbps and they are connected directly through a TP-LINK TL-SG1005D switch which is also 1Gbps. I'm able to get 180Mbps download from [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) on both the rPi and my PC, so they are indeed using 1Gbps and not 100Mbps etherenet.

Why would then the bandwidth through SFTP be only 20MB/s? I can't see what could be the bottleneck, I hope someone can help me out."

raspberry_pi,This solved my issues with YouTube playback (audio and/or video choppiness) (RPi 4),"So, I installed Raspberry Pi OS on my RPi 4 (4GB) - on an SSD, yesterday, and the system itself runs like a god damn dream. However, I've experienced issues with YouTube playback, which seems to be a recurring issue with basically every single RPi owner.

I found a way to completely remove any choppiness and lag on YouTube, and I'm also able to play 1080p 60p YouTube videos without any issues (will vary by bitrate). This is probably the first time I've ever been able to play 60p YouTube videos on a Pi. Locally, even 4K works perfectly fine, but YouTube is a god damn bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before we start:**

\- Browser: Chromium (v80)

\- Extensions: h264ify

&amp;#x200B;

The solution that worked for me is:

**Open the terminal and type/copy:**

    - sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa (or replace nano with your favorite text editor)

**Then look for this string:**

    load-module module-udev-detect

**Got it? ... proceed to add ""tsched=0"" to the string so it looks like this:**

    load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0

**Save and reboot your system**. You should not experience any issues with choppy audio anymore, and a great side-effect is that online video is also smooth as butter. Why? I'm not sure, but it works.

If you have a RPi 4 (4GB) and this doesn't solve your issue, then I'll add some additional system info of my system:

\-RPi 4 - Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit, i.e default)

\-WM: Openbox

\-RAM: 4GB

\-vRAM: 512MB

I tried mode2 and ir-keytable but none of them show anything received. I tested the remote and receiver on Arduino and there it works, so I guess it's either an unsupported protocol or a bad configuration. I connected the receiver to 5V and gpio 18.

raspberry_pi,Control your Raspberry Pi through Telegram,"Hello

&amp;#x200B;

I have developed a Telegram bot that allows you to control your Raspberry Pi.

This is specially useful if your RPi is not in the same network as you (e.g. you are at the street or work and need to control your RPi that is at home) or if you dont have access to a computer terminal.

This is the project repo:  [https://github.com/EnriqueMoran/remoteTelegramShell](https://github.com/EnriqueMoran/remoteTelegramShell)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5fftmv7wth451.gif

The steps for using it are pretty simple:

1. Clone the repo in your RPI: git clone https://github.com/EnriqueMoran/remoteTelegramShell.git
2. Install pyTelegramBotApi module using pip (pip3): pip3 install pyTelegramBotApi
3. On Telegram, create a new bot (talk to BotFather) and save the bot's token) (see image2).
4. Open cloned folder and edit config.txt filling the blanks. File paths must be absolute (see image3).
5. Run the python script: python3 telegramShellBot.py (or python3 telegramShellBot.py &amp; to run it in background).
6. Now you can control your RPi through Telegram! (see image 4).

This sub was a invaluable ressource to get things up and running. Then I ordered a temperature controlled Argon Fan Hat which didn't work because the script it uses isn't compatible with DietPi. But again using mostly this sub I managed to get it to run. I started creating different files that were supposed to work together and were really shotty but after three days of neglecting a lot of things I had to do I now have a single neat script that does everything perfectly and my first complete Repo on Github that will tell future me how to do this in case I need to start fresh. I learned so much in the process. And maybe someone in the same situation as me 3 days ago will find my repo and save themselves 3 days of anguish.

raspberry_pi,"snakeware - a free Python-based Linux distro, now with RPi 4 support!","[https://github.com/joshiemoore/snakeware/](https://github.com/joshiemoore/snakeware/)

snakeware is a free Python-based Linux distro inspired by the Commodore 64. You are booted directly into the Python interpreter, which you can use to do whatever you want with your computer. We have a fun window manager with a suite of apps that do not use X11; snakewm draws directly to /dev/fb0.

We have recently extended support to the Raspberry Pi 4, as we believe this is the ideal platform to realize the ""modern Commodore 64"" vision on. It's still early days for the Pi images, and they currently perform much worse than on x86, but it will really be something special once we get some kinks hammered out.

We are constantly looking for more contributors. Those with specialized RPi knowledge are now particularly sought, as we have to resolve some issues before the RPi builds are ready for ""prime time"", so to speak. However, if you have any amount of Python experience, you are encouraged to contribute apps. If you know anything about pygame/pygame\_gui, you are already a qualified snakeware app dev!

Here is a brief playlist chronicling the development of snakeware so far, for those interested: [snakeware playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPaspA7V-G6Q3IiyPEVN6Scx0lY5zxjCT)

Thank you, have fun!"

raspberry_pi,Yet Another: How to Ethernet over USB to Pi Zero (Pop!_OS 20.04LTS edition!),"I have been trying to get this new Raspberry Pi Zero W going, for the Pwnagotchi project. I `dd`'d the img over, made the appropriate `config.toml`, `config.txt`, and `cmdline.txt` changes as per every blog and previous reddit post I could get my hands on...

And nothing works.

I am running three things while plugging the Pi into my laptop:

* `watch -n1 ifconfig`
* `dmesg -w`
* `watch -n1 ls /dev`

And I let the Pi take a full two minutes to make sure it's getting all the way through its boot process.

Nothing. No logs per dmesg, and no changes or blips under the other two commands. I have tried multiple cmdline.txt variations:

* `modules-load=dwc2,g_ether`
* `modules-load=dwc2,g_serial`
* `modules-load=dwc2,g_cdc`

I have also tried multiple config.txt variations:

* `dtoverlay=dwc2`
* `dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral`
* `dtoverlay=dwc2dr_mode=peripheral`

I have checked the `interfaces.d` config for `usb0-cfg`; all's clear there:

    allow-hotplug usb0
    iface usb0 inet static
    address 10.0.0.2
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 10.0.0.0
    broadcast 10.0.0.255
    gateway 10.0.0.1

Sooo.... I have no idea what I could tweak or push next. My main driver is a Linux(Pop!\_OS)20.04LTS laptop, but I have also tried connecting it to a MacBook2018(Catalina10.15.2) with all the same nothingness.

Promise that I have been googling and searching reddit, and I am finding a lot, but nothing yet has helped me get it working, OR even find some artifacts of what error there even is.

P.S. Yes the USB to microUSB cable supports data transfer and is not just for charging."

3. The help pages are similar to the XQCD comics in that nobody seems to really communicate how they fixed it: https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/1482

4. I've updated /home/pi/sdk-folder/third-party/alexa-rpi//bin/license.sh and typed ""yes"" but this doesn't fix the problem

5. I don't know how to integrate the alternative KITT work wake engine--I don't know where to clone it to or how to point to it. I haven't seen any instructions advertised for how to do this

Any help is greatly appreciated.

There are two places license-key.txt can be located:

* /home/pi/sdk-folder/third-party/alexa-pi/config

* /home/pi/third-party/alexa-rpi/config

Both must be updated. Rebuild everything after to see if it works."

I am working on my first Raspberry Pi project where I am creating a 2 player arcade cocktail table. So far everything has gone great. I have my buttons and sticks configured, the cabinet is ready, I just need to get it all set up within the cabinet now.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER

I have hit a snag and I cannot find help online that fixes my issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it's all going to be fitted the screen will be portrait so I would like the display of the Pi to reflect this. 

The common answer is adding the display\_rotate=1 to the config.txt file however when I do this, I get absolutely no display at all.

After investigating futher people have suggested to not use this on the Pi 4 for one reason or another but I cannot for the LIFE of me find any alternative solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this an issue with the Rasperry Pi 4? What I have found online seems to suggest so - but I would have thought there would be some sort of workaround? I have searched and searched and all I can find is outdated suggestions (most of which just say use display\_rotate).

&amp;#x200B;

I am completely stuck and would love to get this working for my Dad but I just cannot seem to figure it out and my very limited knowledge of the Pi isn't helping me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice, suggestions etc would be really appreciated as it is just frustrating the hell out of me that I seem to be having an issue with what I assumed would be the easiest stage of this project.

&amp;#x200B;

raspberry_pi,Can't exit out of emergency mode,"This morning I had a power outage and my Pi 4 was abruptly shut off. This has happened before and it wasn't an issue, I was able to boot back in just fine. This time though, after realizing i wasn't able to connect to SSH, I connected it to a screen and it instructed me to enter my root password and use `exit` or `systemctl default` to boot back into default mode. I did both of these, and it just looped back to where it was. I restarted normally (with `shutdown`) a few times, to no avail. Tried looking it up, which told me to exit a file on the `boot` partition after plugging the SD card into a different computer. I tried this, but Windows returns that the media is write-protected. 

While booting, I'm given the option to enter recovery mode and re-install Raspian. I'm hesitant though - because while this seems like it might work, i don't know if it would wipe my data. I suppose it's my fault for not backing it up, but it would be good to know if there's a way to get it out of emergency mode without wiping my home dir. It seems like my data is still there, if not corrupted maybe (judging purely on how much it says the card is full on the recovery menu).

Thanks"

raspberry_pi,Do I have a bad WiFi module on my Pi?,"Hey guys, I’ve been having problems connecting to WiFi. I’m working on this project, using an almost brand-new Raspberry Pi 3B (I had previously used it as a Pi-Hole adblocker connected to my network through Ethernet) that requires it to have a wireless connection to the internet. I get the OS loaded and go to connect, and…”No wireless interface found.” To the forums! There I found numerous solutions to my problem: manually changing the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and the /etc/network/interfaces files, reloading the OS, checking rfkill to see if wlan0 is listed, and nothing worked. Is there something I’m missing, or does my Pi just have a bad WiFi module?"

raspberry_pi,"Highly customizable, open source infoboard app - big update","About a year ago, I've posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/9o5x6m/open_source_infoboard_app_written_in_vuejs_hosted/) about an infoboard app I'm creating. Today, I've pushed a big update to Github. A lot of code cleanup, refactoring of some of the features. Updated weather source from DarkSky (since Apple acquired it, you're no longer able to register for a new API key) to ClimaCell.

Full source code available on [GitHub here](https://github.com/SixBytesUnder/infoboard)

I've also set it up as a normal app on a public server, so that you can see a [live demo](https://infoboard.sixbytesunder.com/) which uses the NASA image of the day option.

The original idea for the app, was to display photos from our RPi powered NAS on an old tablet that's too slow to use on a daily basis anymore. Since the app uses VueJS and NodeJS, it can be installed anywhere you have Node.

There's a separate branch with data from local SDS011 and DHT22 sensors for temperature and air quality, which is working, but needs a bit of cleanup.

## Features

* Almost everything is configurable in .env file;
* Shows current time and date;
* Background images, changing every 60 seconds. Source of images can be: a local folder, [NASA Picture of the day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html), random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) or curated images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/);
* Current weather and weekly forecast from [ClimaCell](https://www.climacell.co/);
* Additional weather details (also from ClimaCell) include:
   * humidity,
   * wind speed,
   * barometric pressure,
   * air quality (PM2.5 and PM10),
   * many more.
* Transport for London status updates for tube, overground, dlr, tfl rail and tram;
* Transport for London bus timetable for bus stops you choose;
* Everything, except for time can be folded or expanded by clicking on their icons;
* Two buttons at the bottom right corner allow skipping to the next image or skip the entire folder to the next one (for local images source only);
* If your browser supports programmatic fullscreen mode, a third button will appear to switch browser to fullscreen;
* Runs as a responsive website therefore can be accessed on any device;
* Available as [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (Progressive Web Application) - add a shortcut to infoboard that looks just like an app on your phone or tablet and don't bother using a browser.

My issue is getting my RPi to be configure to bridge the network between my NVR and router. I have followed a few tutorials to set up the RPi to bridge mode but it seems I continue to not have luck.  


The problem I am running into is that the NVR which is connected the RPi via eth0 is not able to connect to the internet. The NVR needs to connect to the internet to allow p2p to work, p2p allows me to set up my NVR so I can use a mobile app while I am not at home.  


These are tutorials that I have followed that do not work for me. The top three almost all work, I just can't connect to the network. The last one is just a routed AP method. I can not have a routed method for this.

Yes, the remote is sending on 433Mhz..

raspberry_pi,rpi4 + SenseHat temp troublepoopin,"Hello all =\]  


  
\&gt;&gt;&gt;TL;DR - Really odd to me. Sometimes I  get a couple good readings with this script, othertimes I let it run for 20 minutes and have hundreds of temperature readouts as ""nan"".  After researching, I believe the nan comes up when the temperature sensor reads above 100 degrees F. 

\&gt;&gt;&gt;Question - Others that have the SenseHat, is the temperature sensor even worthwhile if the temperature of a running rpi4 overheats it and prevents any output over 100? If I am accurate on this assumption, how did y'all overcome it with using the sensehat (instead of opting to use another sensor )? If you're still reading at this point ... how come sometimes the temperature output changes from Celsius to Fahrenheit? I put in a formula to convert it, but rpi seems to swap which one to use.  


&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;&gt;Python3 script:

&amp;#x200B;

\#importing sensor, date, os modules 

from sense\_hat import SenseHat

from datetime import datetime

from csv import writer

sense\_data.append(round(sense.get\_pressure()))

sense\_data.append(round(sense.get\_humidity()))

return sense\_data

\#purging older test file if it exsists

I wanted a solution that allowed me to plug in any Pi and have it instantly be able to hook into all of the services hosted on other Pis on my home network and this solution was born.  So far I have successfully passed temperature data from one Pi to another with each Pi having zero previous knowledge of the other.  I'd love to hear what you think and how this system could be improved."

raspberry_pi,Use CSI camera with Chromium,"Hey everyone,

I recently bought three CSI cameras to monitor my leopard geckos and my 3D printer during night. I wanted to publish the stream to a Youtube live stream so I need the cameras to work in Chromium or any other browser. I tried it with Chromium but it doesn't find the camera. The camera itself works and I am in the correct groups. Here is what I tried, it is only one link, cause I didn't really find anything.

raspberry_pi,"Cups Printing Issue, NOOB help","So I setup my raspberry pi with a dell 1320c printer, it doesnt have the ethernet module so it's hooked up via USB.  Here's my issue.  It appears no matter what driver you use it overrides the one in cups (as in windows uses it's own and such).  So using IPP I can print from my windows box to the printer just fine.

On my mac 10.15.5 (did on older OS too), I hooked up the printer using USB, I used the FX Docuprint C525A-AP v3.2 driver since dell doesnt really have a driver that works, and I can print just fine. However when I add the printer via IPP it goes through but never actually prints.  I'm at a loss.  I have tried using Airprint with no help either."

raspberry_pi,Dead Pi board? don't chuck it just yet!,"I know this doesn't qualify as a project as such but just thought it might potentially save someone throwing out an otherwise fixable Pi.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my Pi stopped getting power to the board (almost certainly my own fault for constantly removing the power connector), anyhow I noticed that if I pushed the Micro USB plug upwards pretty firmly it'd come on sporadically. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you'll be aware the USB cable for the PSU isn't carrying any data just DC 5V +/-, using a multimeter I checked which to see which pins were +/- with the PSU connected. 

&amp;#x200B;

Removed the damaged Micro USB connector on the board (carefully), used some thin gauge wire and ran it through the mounting holes and then soldered it to a DC jack and found a nice gap next to the RJ45 port. I actually tinned the spare leg of the DC jack and soldered it lightly to the RJ45 port (you'll need to scratch away the surface with a file/blade for the solder to stick) 

&amp;#x200B;

Soldered a DC plug on to the old 5V PSU (make sure the boot is on before you solder this on!). Finally used some hot glue just to stop any shorts &amp; to make it more secure, took a notch out of the Pi case to accommodate the larger power connector. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sort of related: I have noticed when using an external SATA USB connector the Pi seems to draw phantom power after booted (that is to say you can disconnect the psu) but doesn't seem to work in a power off state. I guess a Pi 4 could use POE? not sure if you need WOL to be enabled.....I have a Pi 3B+ 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope it helps someone, included some pics (yes it's not going to win any beauty contests for soldering/hot glue!)

I think it would be great to have some easy modules to add ILP (Interledger Protocol) streaming payment modules for the Pi platform. Try and think of any service a Pi might host/provide that users could pay for via ILP. You can look up Coil and Interledger Protocol for technical basics. 

As an example, when Coil subscribers watch my videos on youtube (to the lifeboats) they send me fractions of a penny via cryptocurrency (XRP). There's also Cinnamon video which is a platform for subscribers to stream money as they watch videos with their Coil subscription.

raspberry_pi,SPI slows down raspi,"Hey Everyone!

For my Master thesis i am using a raspi model 4 with 4GB. The goal is to run a neuronal Network on the pi to produce PWM Signals to Control a Power Electronics circuit. 
So far i am able to deploy my Trained Model on the raspi an produce the Output PWM Signal. Since the PWM Signal runs with 100kHZ i only have 10micro seconds for the Production of the new PWM Signal which relies of some inputs I measure (volts and currents) the problem is when I measure the time the neuronal network needs to give me my output it yield 3.6 micro seconds. Whe in a add the Code for the SPI communication for reading in my Volatge and Current values the time my model needs increases to 7.5micro seconds.. even though I do „spi.close()“ before starting the time measurement.. 
so my question is if it is possible that the fact that I create a SPI object in my code reduces the Computational power somehow?

Thanks in advance!"

raspberry_pi,Rackmounted PiHole,"I've been using a Pihole for quite some time now, and in the beginning had the Raspi in its default case just hanging in my server rack. A few months ago (man, time flies during quarantine) I decided to upgrade my server and some other components in the rack, and just do some general housekeeping, so giving the PiHole a more permanent home was in order.

I like designing stuff and while I do realize this maybe overkill for *just* a PiHole, who cares. I enjoyed creating this and seeing it come to fruition.

As with anything, I started with a sketch to layout my ideas.

https://preview.redd.it/o6x5srka7q251.jpg?width=1534&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4115c1c5c1e601b38e8cdee7fb2a9b2e480d86e4

I knew I wanted it to be more than just a mounting point for the PiHole and I wanted it to have more functionality. My thought was that if I mounted the Raspi on the back, I could pass through the more important connections, add a screen to run PADD, some LEDs to show different statuses, a power button, and a network port to connect to the nearby switch.

&amp;#x200B;

[The first rendering I created based on the original sketch.](https://preview.redd.it/yfmf0ucb8q251.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98a459d62b6331a8596be88feb1fbe399966d0bf)

&amp;#x200B;

[Rendering of the back side.](https://preview.redd.it/0ob65hl7fq251.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3d437fe3121e456f416289f1b4f8d968ba4f753)

I do most of my work in AutoCAD and use Sketchup to create the models. On the back side rendering you can see the 3D printed Raspi case that I intended to use. It's two parts, has mounting tabs for attaching to the rack plate, has a place for a 30 mm (?) fan that blows directly on the main heatsink.

I started with [this case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3714695) and modified it for more ventilation, and to overall save some filament. It worked out really well, and my favorite detail is the LAN ports sit flush with the top of the case.

&amp;#x200B;

[The 3D printed case with fan and fan cover.](https://preview.redd.it/bllcr3j3gq251.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3f3e28a16cd6ca5990dc1cc07809e6df61ab235)

Once I had the design figured out, I ordered the front panel from [FrontPanelExpress.com](https://FrontPanelExpress.com), which was really easy and pretty quick. The artwork was designed in AutoCAD, transferred to Illustrator and then cut from vinyl sticker sheets using a Cricut Maker.

&amp;#x200B;

[The front panel after applying the graphics.](https://preview.redd.it/k3hlwr3wgq251.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f25c946950be3fb0c2b7f8ed15a805ab545c6d3)

The screen is a [GeekPi 5"" Capactive Touchscreen](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0749D617J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and was super easy to setup. Since I don't really interface with the Raspi or PiHole through the screen, the touchscreen wasn't necessary, but I figued since I was getting one anyway, why not. This way I could reuse it or change how I access the Pi in the future. It works really well.

https://preview.redd.it/5qeob2v1hq251.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a72603ad54bab3761b68bb98884609247c5d52

Once I had all the components, I put the whole thing together. Cable management on the backside was something I should've put more thought into, as some of the pass through connectors are quite long for such a tight space. Unfortunately, I don't have any photos of the back once assembled, and I'm too lazy to pull it out of the rack to take pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

[Finished product in my rack.](https://preview.redd.it/al84c37jiq251.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ece3346e5b68e98f9aeb1a032c50782594bc585)

All in all, an over-elegant solution for something rather simple. If I had to to do it all again, I would probably for a 1U setup, with a smaller screen and a case/box instead of just a flat plate."

I did some research and what i found was a webpage would be good for this. However, all the posts I saw were from a few years ago. Is there any other better alternative? Also, if I was making a webpage, how would I go about doing this? How can I periodically retrieve and update the information every minute?

I would prefer to make it using Python.

Any help is appreciated!"

This is my first full project, I know it’s very basic but thought I’d share.

I got all but one thing from https://thepihut.com/

The fan is from eBay, I took off the usual connector and directly wrapped the cable round the correct pins(made sure they was only touching the pins needed) and pushed the TV Hat on top; Not ideal but works so far.

Temp seem to stay around 37c when I’ve checked.

I can schedule recordings and view content from any device with LibreElec as the OS.

raspberry_pi,Remotely accesible Raspberri Pi that can be used as WOL device,"Let's say I am at work or in another country for that matter but has a  Raspberry PI at home that is on and can be accessed remotely (TeamViewer  like) and then use WOL to wake up devices on my home network. I have not been able to get the TeamViewer WOL function to work with any of my devices.

Ignore everything below.

I am writing this because I tried posting this earlier and got auto removed cuz there was too little text. I am writing this again because I am really interested in doing something like that."

raspberry_pi,rpi as openvpn client - tls error.,"I have been trying to setup rpi as a vpn client, so i can carry it anywhere and connect to home network. The pivpn server is running on another rpi and i am able to successfully connect to vpn server suing my windows 10 client or a mobile (andoid) client.

however when i tried to connect with rpi client , i get tls error. Both the pi client and other clients are on same network. Appreciate if someone can throw some lights.

raspberry_pi,"Raspberry Pi 4 green status LED flashes: 4 long, 4 short","A couple of days ago I installed a RPi 4 with SSD boot, so it runs without any SD card inserted. I've been running a couple of servers on it and it worked perfectly so far.

However, I just rebooted it through SSH and now it doesn't get an IP address anymore.  
I don't have a micro-HDMI adapter, so I can't check the console but after inspecting the green status LED I noticed a specific, reoccurring pattern: 4 long flashes followed by 4 short flashes.

Could that indicate ""start.elf not launched"" as described [here](https://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Green_LED_blinks_in_a_specific_pattern)? Is it unable to boot from my SSD?  
Or is that a different pattern?"

The python script works perfectly fine on its own. I wrote the PHP code such that it would run the python script from the shell\[ $command =  escapeshellcmd( ' python /home/pi/program1.py'); $output = shell\_exec($command); echo $output;\]  
Now, the PHP code is fine because its able to run a python script without any GPIO components and the python script is also fine because its able to run on its own. The problem arises when I try to connect everything together and control my GPIO pins using my PHP code. I searched the web for this problem but couldn't find any solution."

Having a hard time searching for answers to your Raspberry Pi questions? Let the r/raspberry_pi community members search for answers *for you*!^(†) Looking for help getting started with a project? Have a question that you need answered? Was it not answered last week? Did not get a satisfying answer? A question that you've only done basic research for? Maybe something you think everyone but you knows? **Ask your question here,** operators are standing by!

Are you a regular of /r/raspberry_pi? Please don't downvote just because you already know all the answers. This helpdesk and idea thread is here so that the front page won't be filled with these same questions day in and day out:

1. Q: Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do with my Pi?  
A: [Sure, look right here!](http://f2z.net/rpi)
1. Q: My Pi is behaving strangely, what do I do?  
A: It's either a bad SD card or power problems. 99.999% of the time it's one of these two things. Use a multimeter to measure the 5V on the GPIO pins and/or get a new SD card.
3. Q: The screen is just blank, what do I do?  
A: [Follow these steps](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
5. Q: Which model of Raspberry Pi should I get?  
A: Get the Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM
6. Q: Can I use SD card from another Pi in my Pi 4?  
A: Only if the SD card already has Raspbian Buster
7. Q: I found an old guide that tells me exactly how to do something, should I follow it?  
A: Yes, follow it. If you get stuck *then* come back and describe the *exact* step you are stuck on.
8. Q: When will the revised Pi 4 that fixes the power problem be released?  
A: [Version 1.2 of the Pi 4 fixes the USB-C power issues](https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/02/24/raspberry-pi-4-rev-1-2-fixes-usb-c-power-issues-improves-sd-card-resilience/)
9. Q: Can I use a Raspberry Pi as a Minecraft Server?  
A: Yes, but it will perform terribly, even on a Pi 4.
2. Q: My Pi won't boot, how do I fix it?  
A: [Step by step guide for boot problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
1. Q: Would a Raspberry Pi make a good NAS? What about the 4?  
A: No models of the Raspberry Pi will perform well as a NAS.
1. Q: I want to watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon/Vudu/Disney+ on a Pi but the tutorial I followed didn't work, does someone have a working tutorial?  
A: Use a Fire Stick/AppleTV/Roku. Pi tutorials used tricks that no longer work or are fake click bait.
1. Q: I want to know how to do a thing, not have a blog/tutorial/video/teacher/book explain how to do a thing. Can someone explain to me how to do that thing?  
A: Uh... What?
1. Q: Is it possible to use a Raspberry Pi to do multiple things?  
A: **YES**. The Pi is capable of multitasking and can run more than one program and service at the same time. (Also known as ""workload consolidation"" by Intel people.)
1. Q: How do I protect Pi from power loss? What do I use for powerbank/battery?  
A: Most recent UPS/Battery/Powerbank discussion is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ge17ku/mobile_power_for_larger_builds_not_power_banks_pls/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dz9f3n/battery_backup_or_ups_for_raspberry_pi_4b/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d6tp5x/how_you_guys_protect_your_running_raspberry_pi/)
1. Q: I only have one outlet and I need to plug in several devices, what do I do?  
A: They make things called [power strips](https://www.google.com/search?q=power+strip).
1. Q: I tried to search but didn't find any answers, can someone Google it for me?  
A: Replace ""raspberry pi"" in your search with ""linux"" or ""debian""
4. Q: The red and green LEDs are on/off/blinking but it doesn't work, can someone help me?  
A: [Start here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=58151)
1. Q: Can I use this screen that I took from a ____ ?  
A: [No](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ebmtjl/2019_dec_16_stickied_𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐊_thread_do_you_need/fbdf9mo/)
1. Q: I'm trying to run x86 software on my Raspberry Pi but it doesn't work, how do I fix it?  
A: Get an x86 computer. A Raspberry Pi is ARM based, not x86.
1. Q: Should I add a heatsink, fan, or some kind of cooling to my Raspberry Pi?  
A: If you think you need one then you should add it
1. Q: I run my Pi headless and there's a problem with my Pi and the best way to diagnose it or fix it is to plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard, what do I do?  
A: Plug in a monitor &amp; keyboard.
1. Q: My Pi seems to be causing interference preventing the WiFi from working  
A. Using [USB 3 cables that are not properly shielded can cause interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/gp3jhm/raspberry_pi_4s_usb_30_ports_are_causing/) and the [Pi 4 can also cause interference when HDMI is used at high resolutions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-4-wi-fi-problem-firmware-update-will-fix-your-screen-resolution-bug/).

Before posting your question think about if it's really about the Raspberry Pi or not. [If you were using a Raspberry Pi to display recipes, do you really think r/raspberry_pi is the place to ask for cooking help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/d11ia1/raspberry_pi_in_kitchen_can_i_substitute/) **There may be better places to ask your question**, such as:

* /r/AskElectronics
* /r/AskProgramming

The file ran and launched the chromium browser from autostart but I had no menu and if I closed chromium I was back to a blank screen. I deleted all the text in the auto start file so it wasnt running anything, but my screen was still blank. After I deleted the auto start file, the issue went away. What's happening and how do I make it stop happening?

raspberry_pi,DigiAMP+ voltage issues,"I'm (constantly) building and improving on my Pi3-based audio/video player (pi+kodi+ultrashort throw projector+Ikea drawer+...). The audio/hifi part is using a DigiAMP+ from IQaudio, and it plays its part quite well. But I've had a couple issues lately, and I might use some insight from anyone with a similar setup.

So the DigiAMP+ is plugged as a HAT, but provides power to the Pi. It's supposed to be able to feed from anything between 12 and 19 (maybe even 24)V. At first, I used an old 12V/1.5A to power the whole thing. Worked, but I very often had the ""lightning"" icon displayed. So I recently switched to a more powerful PSU, 19V/3.5A. I'd expected my undervoltages to disappear, but they didn't.

Then it created a second, now problem : every now and then, audio output shuts itself off for a second or so. I'd say it's whenever audio volume gets too high (for instance, it occurs much more often the more I set software volume high).

I'm not too sure what to do at that point. My former PSU gave better results, so I might as well switch back, but I like to understand. And so far I'm not even sure where too look, nor whether it's an hardware problem (DigiAMP+ delivering unstable voltage) or a software one. I obviously don't have anything power-hungry on that Pi (the only USB peripheral is a keyboard/mouse 2.4GHz dongle)."

I mean, when I foolishly decided to use my 4gb Pi 4 as a home PC, the RAM situation was absolutely fine. The maximum amount of RAM I used reached only just about 3 gigs during some gaming stress tests. Problem is, the CPU tends to randomly spike to around 90% usage, with an average of about 50% (If I'm lucky)

I get that there's definitely a use for something like this, but if the Pi foundation is still trying to actually be a desktop replacement as many news outlets say, then that's ridiculous.

I don't mind having an ARM processor, I just want one that's as equally capable as the other components. I wouldn't mind paying $100 USD for a top of the line model. Maybe even have actual flash storage too? The old Micro SD method has been archaic for years and it's well overdue for them to move on.

Kudos if you actually read this wall of text. The Pi 4's initial release amazed me back in 2019, and I think it's in the Foundation's best interest to save their features for an entirely new model. We're definitely not in a position to start releasing S models like Apple all willy- nilly now, right?"

raspberry_pi,"Pi camera modules not detected — Troubleshooting advice, please?","Hi there!

I've been trying to get a camera module to work here, with no joy. The troubleshooting I've done so far:

* Tried with two different modules (Pi cam 2.1 and Pi NoIR cam 2.1)
* Tried with four different Pi units (two Zero W, one 4B and one 3B)
* Tried different ribbon cables (three that fit the Zero and two that fit the 3B and 4B)
* Tried reversing the cable orientation one end at a time, just to be sure I hadn't got that wrong, but even with contact fingers of the cable ends facing the circuit boards at both ends, no luck
* Both camera modules are known to have worked fine with one of the Zero Ws before
* I have enabled the Camera interface in raspi-config (section P1)
* vcgencmd get\_camera returns: supported=1 detected=0
* Also tried to make sure that that tiny cable that connects the camera to its module board is seated properly (on both modules)
* sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2 returns expected response: Nothing — No errors whatsoever
* cat /boot/config.txt |grep start\_x returns start\_x=1

raspberry_pi,Raspberry Pi 4 UEFI Boot,"Hello! So i've been testing out [https://rpi4-uefi.dev/](https://rpi4-uefi.dev/) the UEFI firmware implementation for the Pi.

I just wanted to post my experience with it and how I got it working with Fedora 32.

Ok so first off I noticed that the install page of the UEFI implementation says you should partition the SD card with just one partition containing the UEFI firmware. Keep in mind it does not specify the size and it does not say use the whole sd card. My config is a 128MB fat partition (it has to be FAT as per instructions). We will come back to why you should not use the whole SD card soon.

After you have the SD card setup you can plug it and be greeted by the UEFI boot screen. You can enter the settings menu and browse around. You will need to read up on the firmware and its limitations as it is extremely incomplete.

Now you will need to create a fedora 32 bootable aarch64 usb stick. Exactly as you would a usb install stick for an x86 PC (I would imagine this is the purpose of the UEFI firmware project). From here actually everything happens just like on a x86 PC.

You can install the OS directly on a USB connected drive, and it should work just fine. I opted for extra complexity so I decided to use an iSCSI root. This is where stuff gets complicated and this is the reason for not partitioning the whole SD card:

There are essentially 3 moving parts to the boot process, the UEFI firmware which resides on the SD card and is not removable or transferable to a usb device, the bootloader aka GRUB2, and the root. It is possible to mix and match the bootloader and the root: You can have the root on a usb drive, iSCSI LUN or the SD card (untested). The bootloader can also be either on a separate USB drive than the root, the same drive as the root, or the SD card (recommended). 

On fedora the bootloader is split into 2 partitions namely the EFI system partition, and what I gather is the partition which contains the kernel and initrd (aka /boot). I had issues when /boot was xfs, I don't know why. It worked once and then it did not probably because of the experimental nature of the UEFI firmware.

When I installed fedora I wanted access to all 4 of the USB ports, so I installed as follows: UEFI on SD card 128MB, Efi system partion (grub2) default size as set in installer, the /boot partition also default size as set in installer, and the root on an iSCSI LUN. My boot process is as follows: 

1) Load UEFI firmare from partition 1

2) Load grub2 from EFI system partition

3) Load kernel and initrd from /boot partition

4) mount iSCSI root, switch root, and complete bootup

CAVEATS

1) The caveats to this are that the UEFI firmware only understands MBR. So I imagine (untested) more than 3 partitions on the SD card might make it unbootable.

2) dmesg is plagued by this message:

And probably many many more bugs, incompatibilities, etc. I would imagine hardware acceleration does not work. But the process of getting the OS on the raspberry pi with this setup correctly, is exactly the bog standard x86 PC provisioning. Just plug in the usb stick install and profit. With more updates this will probably become the defacto way of using the pi."

The 12v battery will range between 12.3 - 14.5v throughout the day / night, and I'm not sure how this will translate through the buck converter. 

Will it keep a steady 5v or will this fluctuate up and down, if so would the pi be okay with this?

I'm also new to circuit boards, so any criticism of my design is welcome. It's a result of lots of googling &amp; research over the last few weeks.

I'm not entirely sure if I'll be able to read the voltages, I think PCF8591 needs to share a common ground, but this may already be the case (will all my negatives be common?)"

raspberry_pi,Audio stuttering with Pi Zero W and Airplay via Shairport Sync,I'm having audio stuttering issues with my Pi Zero W using [shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) and a [Sabrent usb DAC](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OJ5AV8I/) I got off Amazon. I'm running pi-hole and raspotify as well but it's not reporting high usage at all in ram or cpu%. Is there anything I can do for this? I'm trying to play Apple Music thru the Pi Zero W. Thanks
