arduino,Can I use a usb bluetooth adapter on a Leonardo?,I have a little Beetle board that is a Leonardo clone. I need it for it's small footprint (20x20mm). I was wondering if I can use a bluetooth dongle in place of a USB-c cable for communication with my computer. Or would I need driver software of some sort?

arduino,"Need help understanding some variables and functions for the first time (verbose, buffer, atoi, atof, strchr, struct)","I need to understand the code from [this](https://www.ardumotive.com/new-cnc-plotter.html) project for school (mini cnc), and it's mostly progressing, but there are a few things in which I'm having some difficulty finding about online.

**verbose** and **buffer** seem to be variables, but when I copy-paste the code to arduino IDE, the text goes orange, so I'm assuming they differ in something. Are they really data types or am I wrong, and if so how do they differ from ""normal"" int variables? These are new to me.

I also didn't find anything on arduino reference about this argument(?) **struct** that the code uses a couple of times, it seems to have something to do with strings but I'm not sure and I can't look it up right now. Same goes for **atoi**, **atof** and **strchr**, I've seen a little about atoi (used to turn strings into integers?) but not about the others."

arduino,A picture book teaches C programming basics,"When I was learning C programming, I found that the books were written like references rather than books to read straight through. This inspired me to create a fun and friendly C programming book for beginners called *A Day in Code*. It's in the form of a picture book and tells a story about a fun day using C programs that represent situations in the story. 

I mentioned Arduino at the end of the book as an application that uses C programming. One of my major motivations is to help beginners understand the basics of C programming before programming on the Arduino. 

You can check it out here: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/173590791X](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/173590791X).

I’m creating a series of these books and recently released *A Day in Code: Python.* I want to start a new series that's in a similar format to these books, but translates classic nursery rhymes and fairy tales into code. I launched ""Learn Python through Nursery Rhymes and Fairy Tales"" on Kickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/914595512/learn-python-through-nursery-rhymes-and-fairy-tales](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/914595512/learn-python-through-nursery-rhymes-and-fairy-tales). If this is successful, I will create a C programming version in the future!"
arduino,How to trick an airbag controller,"Not exactly Arduino related, but hopefully someone can help. I have a 2001 Miata that has a switch in order to deactivate the passenger side air bag. There is a light that turns on when the airbag is turned off. I'm removing the panel where the switch is located (replacing it with a simple rocker switch, it's a ground signal) but now that the light is missing, the airbag light on the dash is on. The light in the panel gets voltage from the cars ignition system on one leg, then the other leg is connected to the SAS control module which completes it to ground if the switch is off. If the airbag is turned on (the light would be off) then both legs of the light circuit are energized with +14.4v and when the airbag is turned off, one leg gets switched to ground by the SAS control module, thus completing the circuit and turning the light on.

The problem is that the SAS Control Module somehow knows if that light is there, so now that I've removed it, the airbag light on the dash flashes.

Can I add a resistor to trick the module into thinking there is a light there?

Here are my multimeter measurements:

With the car running and the airbag turned off (light on) there is 13.3v across the light at 0.16mA

With the car running and the airbag on (light is off) there is 14.5v at 0.17mA on BOTH sides of the light.

The resistance of the light itself is measuring at 9 ohms

I tired using a 10ohm 1w resistor, but it keeps burning up.

arduino,What shields do I need (if any),"Hi,

I have a project which requires the Arduino to control:

* Small motor (moving a plastic part 1 cm infrequently)
* 24V fan control (PWM)
* 1 temperature probes (30-60 C range, don't need more precision than 1 C)
* Optional 1 ambient temperature measurement
* Optional air quality control (detection of plastic particles)

I'm a bit confused if I'll need any shields. I'm just starting with electronics so lack of soldering would be a big benefit for me."

I initially ran the project on an uno but switched to a micro to make it more compact. The issue is the code doesnt want to run at all on the micro. I made sure the pins are all in the correct spot, i grounded the sensor to the gnd pin, i added a wait for the serial connection and all that jazz to convert it to micro. 

     The problem is at startup, the code to initiate the sensor just freezes the script entirely, and if i can get it to run (really just by luck im not sure what i did), it will only run the void loop 3-4 times before stopping again. Im not sure what im doing wrong so i just wanted to reach out to see if any of you have experience with this problem. Thanks for any help you can provide, id much appreciate it!

Side note: code still works on uno, just not micro so i think it might have to do with hardware"

arduino,Do you have any ideas for how I can multiplex a segment display without having to read my analog sensor values using the same delay as I use for the multiplexing?,"Currently, I am multiplexing my four digit seven segment display to work with the lm35dz for displaying temperature. I am using 5ms delays to multiplex the display, but unfortunately I have to do my readings just as fast, otherwise the multiplexing will not work. I tried using a 250ms delay for the initial reading itself, then using a for-loop from 0 - 50 for the variable I am displaying, because 250 divided by 5 is equal to 50, so it would display the reading 50 times in 250ms to get to 5ms delay per output if that makes sense, but I couldn't get it working. I would highly appreciate any ideas for how I might achieve my goal.

Thanks in advance :)

The two batches we purchased had either package date or manufacture date stamped on the package and they were spaced 4 weeks apart. We're not sure if it's a manufacturing issue or perhaps we received counterfeit chips. We've opened an RMA with MicroChip, the manufacturer, but we're not sure how long that will take to get resolved. Possibly 6+ months.

 I can’t figure out where that noisy shape comes from. It is noticeable that the perturbation is common to the 3 channels. I thought it might be due to temperature variation or alimentation issues…

I have a question that might be too elementary. 

If you see the butterfly below I wanted to add a simple flapping motion to it, is there a device that can do just that?

My first thought was to combine a mini dynamo with a bunch of cogs, but surely there's already a device for it. 

Appreciate any help!

   value in EEPROM, and also how to change the value manually.

   The result value can then later be included in your project sketch or fetched from EEPROM.

arduino,"I'm trying to make this window open/close automatically, but idk where to start. Any ideas?",
arduino,How can I turn off stepper motors connected through a CNC shield?,"Hi everyone! I'm pretty new to the arduino scene, and I hope I'm posting my question in the right place. I'm struggling to find a way to cut power to my stepper motors when they're not in use. 

So for my current project, I'm using an arduino uno with a HiLetgo CNC shield, two A4988 stepper motor drivers, two NEMA 17 stepper motors and an RTC module. The Arduino itself is currently powered through the USB, and the CNC shield is powered with a 12V DC plug. My goal is to have one stepper motor turn every minute and the other turn every hour, which I've gotten them to do. But they as well as the A4988 drivers get very hot, and I'd like to find a way to shut them off when they're not turning. In addition I'd like the RC module to stay on while the stepper motors are off. I'm aware that stepper motors may skip a step when getting the power back and I'm not too concerned about that at the moment. 

I also have a wire connecting the EN and GND pins on the CNC shield, unsure if that is somehow causing my issue. 

I've read about setting the EN pin (pin 8) to HIGH \[digitalWrite (8, HIGH);\] which I've tried doing to no avail. The stepper motors still get power. I've also tried pinMode (8, OUTPUT); which didn't make a difference. Perhaps there's a way to use the SLEEP pin on the A4988 drivers, but I honestly don't know which number pin I have to use in the code or how to find out which pin controls SLEEP.

Could the fact that the CNC shield is externally powered, or the wire shorting the EN and GND pins be causing the issue? I really hope this doesn't sound too silly but as I said before I'm very new to using Arduinos and stepper motors and am just using it for this project. I'll post my current code in the comments. I hope I've provided enough information. Any advice and answers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"
arduino,Help with RANDOM function.,"Hi all! I'm making a model of a police car, and it has a functional lightbar powered by Attiny85. It works all right, but I wanted to expand the blinking patterns, using the random function, so it will randomly select a pattern, wait until it is finished, then it generates another number, and do another pattern associated with the generated number, rinse and repeat. But currently, it just goes through all the patterns as they are written one after the other, the random function is not working. Blinking patterns work just fine, no problem there.
I believe the problem is somewhere in the syntax. (You can disregard the discrepancy in {}, some are surely missing due to shortening of the text)

Here is part of the code. I won't copy the whole thing, as it is long and pretty much pointless. Important things are the random number generator, and the ifs.
Thank you!

Nonetheless, I can upload a sketch once or twice, then for reasons unknown, the USB port is not recognized anymore. For example, initially I have COM11 and COM15 assigned as USB Serial Port and USB Virtual COM respectively. After a few uploads, COM15 disappears. ONLY A REBOOT can bring it back. Then, I can upload again, make some code changes, upload again, and boom!. Rinse and repeat. The only recourse I \*think\* I have found is to turn off MalwareBytes and Webroot.

arduino,[Question] ¿How to track the distance and position of different individual objects in a dark room?,"Hi! I hope this is the right sub for his question. I'm working on the design of an art installation as a project for my university. I study music and audio design, so my knowledge about electronics is quite limited and I need a bit of guidance with certain topics regarding the implementation of the system that I want to create. I will explain the desired behavior below (there's a floor plan at the bottom for clarity).

The installation consists of a mobile sculpture from which five cristal balls are hanging, each with a different drawing. The lights in the room are off, but there is a light projector casting a strong directional light towards a wall, and the sculpture is between the light and the wall. The sculpture has a crank that can be used by the visitor to rotate the crystal balls. When a crystal ball is in front of the light source, it will cast its shadow on the wall on the other side of the room.

I am working with another artist which task is to solve all things related to the structure and lighting. So the part that corresponds to me is the audio: there's a quadraphonic audio system in the room. I want several audio clips playing back in the room, each of them corresponding to one of the balls. The idea is to have those clips rotating around the space (a square room, with speakers at each corner) in the same way that the mobile sculpture rotates. Also, the closer each ball is to the light projector, the more the volume and clarity of its corresponding audio clip will increase. When a ball arrives at the position which is just in front of the projector and its shadow is projected over the wall, the corresponding audio clip is louder and clearer than all the rest (the other sounds are muffled and distant, I will apply some audio effects). There will be a locked case in the room with an audio interface for routing and a computer running Ableton Live, which will manage the clips and effect automation.

**Now to the problem**: I will design a Max For Live patch to convert all incoming signals into automation data, so I know what to do at that point. What I am not so sure about is how to get the information on the position and distance of each ball. I see that I need a system that can track the position of each ball individually, and transmit the data through five different channels to my computer. I guess that I need some type of transmitter on each ball, and a receiver at the 0 points of my system, which would be the light source. I'm thinking that maybe I can put an Arduino board in the lamp with some kind of receiver or sensor, but I am really lost about what sensor this could be. Bear in mind that the receiver should be aware of the position and distance of each ball at all times, and the distance that the balls are gonna be is from 50 cm (in front of the lamp) to approx. 2 mt (at the other extreme), so I need something that can be reliable at that range of distance. It's also important to notice that besides the projector, the room is dark, and I guess this can affect the possible technologies being used (like a tracking camera, for example).

Any ideas about how to tackle this problem? What types of sensors or other components should I get familiarized with? As I said previously my experience with electronics is quite limited so I consider this as a learning experience as well.

Thanks in advance.

arduino,I don't get how digital pin inputs are measured,"If I get it correctly, for the analog inputs, the Arduino measures the voltage between the pin and ground. But digital pins don't work this way apparently because there are ""floating pins"" which I don't understand what they are because, if it worked the same as analog, if they are connected to nothing then the voltage between the pin and ground would be 0 because everything would equalize, but in reality digital pins give a random input when the pin isn't connected to anything. I have seen pull up and pull down resistors but I don't get what they are used for because it wouldn't make much sense if the arduino actually measured voltage.

Does the arduino measure current then? Or what does it measure exactly? I can't find anything on the internet.

\---------------------------------------------

\#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;

int led = 3;

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------

What I want to happen is that I flip the switch, the servos immediately rotate, there's a full second of nothing, then the led turns on. When flipping the switch back I want the same thing to happen but in reverse order. The issue I have with my code is minor, and it's that the code loops through the first delay no matter what, so when flipping the switch back there is a 1 second delay before turning off the led, waiting another second, then rotation the servos back. It's nitpicky but I'd really like to eliminate the extra second of waiting.  


I read that millis can be used to set up a non-blocking delay of sorts and I'm hoping someone could give me a hand with this as I have not been able to get it to work."

I am an electrician keen to dip the toe in the Arduino world since recently acquiring a CNC table and watching a bunch of Arduino YouTube clips. I’m amazed at the complex problems the hardware can overcome with such an affordable platform. I have no coding background which sucks because I could see Arduino being such an awesome tool to have up the sleeve but I’m literally starting from scratch.

In the meantime, I have a work related problem I’m investigating and would like to know what is the correct way to engage the Arduino community to help me understand what is possible and what isn’t possible. I don’t want to be that guy that spams the sub asking how to do things but I’m not sure where to turn to net a brains trust that can quickly help me increase my understanding of the platform.

The problem I am trying to solve is to know if it is possible to influence the secondary fixed current output of a led driver to dim the light source and subsequently reduce the energy consumption of the luminaire?

The scenario is this. I am replacing hundreds of enclosed car park lights with the goal of saving as much energy as possible. I am limited to fixed output fittings as there is no stock of the variant that contains dimmable drivers and motion sensors. I am hoping that there is an Arduino solution possible that will allow me to integrate an Arduino controller in each fitting to add sensors and dim the fixed output fitting as a way around the supply issue."

With this data I can create a program to calculate the amount of clicks the scope needs on the x and y axis to be more accurate.

The issue is, I am not sure which components would be suitable for doing this. Any general advice that can lead me onto more targeted research would be appreciated."
arduino,Sharing a pin with several TM1637 LED displays,"I've been trying to control five seven-segment displays, each one of them having a TM1637 as the controller.

Well, in practice, if I ignore the fact that these displays would rather share a common clock with different data pins (maybe the labels are incorrect), I still don't get reliable results.

Sometimes one or several displays fail to initialize or even update correctly. Touching/messing with the jumper wires seems to affect the issue.

So I thought: it's noise messing with the data rate, but I changed the data rate in the library from 5us to 5ms with zero effect on the issue.

arduino,Serieal Communication with an Arduino Uno through a USB/Serial converter,"Hi, so I'm a complete novice when it comes to circuitry and electrical tech stuff. Currently I'm putting together a project which requires me to communicate to an Arduino Uno through a separate external USB/Serial converter. (I *do* know that the Arduino Uno has an onboard chip which does exactly what a USB/Serial converter does but I need to use the external one rather than the internal one).  


&amp;#x200B;

So, the specifics:  
I'm using an Arduino Uno, a computer running windows with the Arduino IDE, a breadboard, a bunch of wires and a USB/Serial converter (Specifically USB to TTL FT232RL; which has the pins DTR, RX, TX, VCC, CTS, GND with a micro-USB input)

&amp;#x200B;

So the set up is: 

Computer connected to USB/Serial converter via Usb-&gt;microUSB cable. The converter is connected to the Arduino through wires and the bread board (Converter---&gt;Arduino):

DTR----&gt;RESET

RX----&gt;TX

TX----&gt;RX

VCC----&gt;Vin/5V (I have tried both)

CTS----&gt;Isn't connected to anything

GND----&gt;GND

&amp;#x200B;

What I see:

The Arduino Uno receives power from the computer through its connection to the converter (the power LED lights up) and so does the converter. 

What I want:

To start I just want to be able to use the serial monitor to communicate with the Arduino Board. To do this I wrote a short sketch on the IDE which turns the in built LED on if it receives the input ""1"" from the serial monitor or off if it receives the input ""2"". 

What I did:

I uploaded the sketch to the Arduino through the inbuilt USB connector on the Arduino. I then unplugged the USB and connected the arduino to the wires which connected it to the USB/Serial Converter. I then opened the serial monitor to input the commands to turn the LED on or off however it didnt work. Each time I input something into the serial monitor the X1 led on the Arduino would *briefly* light up but nothing would ultimately change.

Things I've tried and other bits of information:

Firstly, yes I have the right ports and board selected in the IDE. I've tried a bunch of the different programmers in the IDE (AVR ISP mk I and II etc.), I've tried checking all my drivers (they're all up to date), I've tried uploading the sketch through the serial converter itself (same result).

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm not sure what to do and I haven't found resources online where others were using an external USB/Serial converter with an Uno. Any help in achieving what I'm trying to get would be greatly appreciated."
arduino,Help with lights always on through MOSFET,"I am trying to make this circuit below using a MEGA and a 12v PSU externally.  The mega is powered via USB and the LED will be switched from the 12v circuit.  In my eye this ""should"" allow the 12v LED to be switched by the Mega without powering the LED from the 5v on the Mega - I plan to add around 10 more LEDS once I get the small scale working so do need the external PSU solution. I have 12v LEDs ready and if I connect them direct to the PSU they light up. 

I have noticed that as soon as I connect everything the LED is on all the time - on further investigation I noticed I hadn't connected the PSU ground to the MEGA ground pin anywhere in the circuit - is this the reason the LED is always on?  (I have checked for shorts etc but I am certain there are no shorts in the circuit connecting the LED direct to the PSU). 

Is it safe to connect the PSU 12v external ground to the Mega ground (while the Mega is powered via USB)?  

Sorry new to this and don't want to release 'magic smoke' from my Arduino while trying to just switch a brighter LED on and off!

arduino,Atmega88 (and probably Atmega8) timer accuracy,"Recently I've been playing around with some Atmega88 chips and noticed that their timer seems to be much more accurate than that of Atmega328. Simple millis() counter observed via serial monitor worked for about an hour with little to no fault, a result unobtainable with m328 (therefore I always use RTC module when I work with the latter). Is it a workable idea to build simple but accurate clocks using just m88 chip without RTC? Of course, it'll lack the backup-powered memory feature, but I can live with it. Also I heard that Atmega8 is somewhat close to m88 in this regard."
arduino,Looking to start getting into Arduino (Software Engineer),"Hello r/arduino I am a software engineer without much experience in microcontrollers looking to get into Arduino. I have been taking some classes that involve creating virtual circuits and then simulating the results. This is great as a learning experience but kind of boring in practice. So I am looking to purchase a beginner set. My country seems to have no decently priced starter kits (Importation fee's) but I have found reasonably priced individual components.

I already have an objective in mind for my first project (That should get me extra credits in 2 classes at the same time) which is automating plant care. For this I have assembled a short list of stuff to purchase, I would appreciate any comments on what is missing, or anything that could make the build easier.

Arduino Uno  
Mini Breadboard x2 (120 points each)  
20 cm Jumpers x40

arduino,"Making a ""jagged array"" of pointers to character arrays of different lengths","As part of a project with a load of different words of different lengths, I decided to store the character strings in PROGMEM.  Since the arrays themselves vary so wildly in length both of words and the size of the array itself, I looked into making a [jagged array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jagged-array-or-array-of-arrays-in-c-with-examples/). 

The example below is more or less copy-pasted from the example code linked above, adapted for the characters, program memory, and the size of the arrays (both arrays are a size of 12, but have 16 characters each, did I do that right?). The program compiles, then freezes when I try this however. 

My goal is to print each word its appropriate length to the Serial monitor. Not at all sure where to go from here. Guessing I need to account for the size of each word in the array as well?  

I'm using a Teensy 4.1 which doesn't require using the AVRSpace library, which is why you won't see it in the code below. 

    PROGMEM char *testString[] = {""this"", ""telephone"", ""lol""};
    
    PROGMEM char *testStringTwo[] = {""bop"", ""elephant"", ""kelly""};
    
    int Size[2] = { 12, 12 }, k = 0;
    
    char **jagged[] = {testString, testStringTwo};
    
    void setup() {
    
      Serial.begin(9600);
      while (!Serial) {};
    
      Serial.println(sizeof(testString)); //where the number 12 came from
      Serial.println(sizeof(testStringTwo));
    
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
    
        char** ptr = jagged[i];
    
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; Size[k]; j++) {
          Serial.println(*ptr);
    
          ptr++;
        }
    
        Serial.println();
        k++;
        jagged[i]++;
      }
    }

arduino,Is it possible to control this helicopter with an arduino micro instead of the board already on it?,Hello! I have [this](https://imgur.com/a/PrZgJU0) cheap $5 rc helicopter and was wondering if I could control it with an arduino for fun. It looks like all the parts are standard so could I just de solder them from the board and add them to the micro? I know the battery is too small so I would need to add a larger one (I would add a battery in the back and balance the weight) and I would need it write the program to run it. Am I missing anything? Thanks!

As you can see from my prev attempt and subsequent post in this subreddit, I am making a gift for my Gf on the occasion of our anniversary. I'm trying to make a menu that will be having some small messages for her, i want her to be able to navigate through depending on her mood. She's been trying hard to get a job and she smtyms hits a block and loses motivation nd positivity... This is going to be my attempt to cheer her up.

I am trying for 5-6 items in main menu, each menu item having 5-6 Submenu items and Each Submenu item having a single message.

I have followed this tutorial for connections and code [https://techtotinker.blogspot.com/2020/07/arduino-simple-lcd-menu.html?m=1](https://techtotinker.blogspot.com/2020/07/arduino-simple-lcd-menu.html?m=1)

Have 4 buttons on A0 (Enter), A1(Up), A2(Down), and A3(Back)- using them for navigation. I should specify that i am using 2 LCD Screens.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the way i am trying the program to roll out-

*On LCD 1 -* 

""A greeting text""

delay(200)

""Press button 1(Enter)""

*On LCD 2-*

//Main menu

\--&gt;For Confidence         //menuitem1

\--&gt;For Motivation          //menuitem2

\--&gt;For XYZ                       //menuitem3

and so on.....

&amp;#x200B;

*While on menuitem1, Button1 (Enter) is Pressed, Submenu Opens up*

\--&gt;Message 1         //SubMenuitem1

\--&gt;Message 2         //SubMenuitem2

\--&gt;Message 3         //SubMenuitem3

and so on.....

*While on SubMenuitem1, Button1(Enter) is Pressed, Sub-SubMenu Opens up*

Message Text      //Sub-SubMenu

        case 4:
          sub = 3;
          break;
      }
    }

 In this code, I havent touched much parts because i dont understand them and am afraid of messing up because i cant resolve errors too, so avoiding them. (*I have very little knowledge in coding*). I have just added a void beginning() (*for that greeting text*) and replaced the print statements (*for displaying my texts*), and Tried changing the Executeaction() block.

But, Whats happening is, 

The first block of Switch-Case was designed for only displaying a SubMenuitem, 

The 2nd block was created for allowing the user to edit the SubMenuitem, 

and The third block was designed to execute the said operation/SubMenuitem.

**ISSUE 1 -** 

And now though i have changed the print statements, the internal function is still same so whats happening is the place where i want the first Sub-Submenu to appear isnt appearing because that block was designed to just show the SubMenu1 item.

**ISSUE 2 -**

The second block was for editing the value in the selected SubMenu item, I dont Understand whats happening here but so the statement that i replaced here, comes up flawlessly. The Sub-SubMenu text comes up and stays on the screen untill back button is pressed. I wish to have all the blocks, work the same way ,ie, the message should stay untill the user presses back button.

**ISSUE 3-** 

The 3rd block was for executing the operation, so the statement that i changed here, appears fine but after sm milliseconds disappears and then the prev submenu appears. I dont want this. I want the user to decide when to leave the Sub-SubMenu screen.

**Semi-ISSUE 4  -** 

Also since i wont be editing the relay values, can i remove that block?? I was Afraid that i might mess up the Button assigned or something. Please also see if there are some unncessary blocks in this code that arent useful for the output that i am trying to have.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this can be done with Switch Case but i just dont know how to write the block, and assign buttons to each block.

So, I request every1 whos seeing this... Please help me in coding this. Please dont think that i am outsourcing this to you guys, i just need your guidance to point me in the right direction, tell me where i am making mistakes and how can they be rectified. I have searched uptill page 10 of google search ""16x2 LCD Menu with Submenu Arduino"" but i havent been able to find the solution.

If You need to ask me something about this project, feel free to message me or comment down.

Please Help."
arduino,memcpy copies the same array twice,"I'm trying to send an array only when it's updated. So far, I'm using this code:

      if (strcmp(buffer, ""/101908870321\\"") != 0 &amp;&amp; strcmp(buffer, oldBuffer) != 0) {
        memcpy(oldBuffer, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        Serial.println(""Buffer: "" + String(buffer));
        Serial.println(""oldBuffer: ""+ String(oldBuffer));  
      }

Ignore the first strcmp.

The second strcmp compares buffer to oldBuffer and, when they're different, it should memcpy what's in buffer into oldBuffer, but instead I end up with

    Buffer: /102300000000\
    oldBuffer: /102300000000/102300000000\

This is the serial output that I get, no matter what I do. I checked and nothing else prints after oldBuffer, so it can't be another string. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, it's not even the first time I work with C strings."

arduino,MAX30105 Pulse Meter Line Graph Improvements,"Hey Everyone! I recently began playing with the [MAX30102  pulse meter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QC67KMQ/). [Here is a picture of the wiring.](https://i.imgur.com/rrk2N3b.jpg) Super simple.

With a little research I put together [this github project](https://github.com/dcabines/MAX30105). It includes the Arduino sketch, a node web server, and a web page that uses [P5](https://p5js.org/) to draw a line chart. The server reads from the usb port and sends the data straight to a web socket so the page can render the values into a live line chart.

I recorded my screen [here](https://youtu.be/NQr7O8NWRkI) and [here](https://youtu.be/P-HwrG5nc60). I also recorded with my phone [here](https://youtu.be/BReGPjf5d8c). Sorry the phone video is sideways. I tried to capture the big difference between when I have my finger on the meter and when it isn't and how easily it jumps around when my finger is on the meter.

Everything it working pretty well so far, but this sensor is so sensitive the line will jump all over. Any tiny change like breathing and tiny changes in finger pressure will make the values jump around and drown out the heart beat I'm looking to capture. I do have it looking at the latest few values to zoom the chart in and out as needed, but it could be better.

If anyone likes charts and how to smooth this sort of data out I would be super grateful for any tips you may have! I plan on adding a BPM counter next and could use tips for that too. Thank you!"
arduino,Can't Program my Arduino Nano. std500_recv(): programmer is not responding,"I doubt I'm the first person to ask this, but searching the internet hasn't quite solved my issue yet. I have an Arduino Nano that I bought the other day. I want to turn it into a UPDI programmer, but I can't upload anything to it. 

I've tried two different cables, switching between the current and old bootloader for the 328p, and tried doing a loopback test. I think the loopback test failed, but I may just be misunderstanding how to do that. 

For the loopback test, I wired TX1 to RX0 and GND to RST, then plugged it into my computer and tried typing random text into the serial monitor and pressing enter or hitting send. I never saw any output in the serial monitor.

When I plug the board in to my computer via Mini USB, I see the TX LED flash green, the RX LED flash red, ON flash green, and the L LED begins blinking rapidly before settling into the blink program's pattern. TX and RX only flash a few times before turning off.

The board is running the basic blink program from the manufacturer. This seems to work fine. Trying to upload a modified blink to test doesn't work. I'm getting:

    avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
    avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 8 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x31

The response code changes, but as I understand it, the code doesn't help much unless it's either 0x00 or 0xFF.

There is one component whose alignment is a bit sloppy. It's really hard to make out the name, but it looks like 9L14 SMD. By its position, it may interact with the TX LED."
arduino,I'm doing my first Arduino Project. Can you help me to not burn down my house?,"HI!

I've been toying around with an Arduino UNO for a while, but so far, I have not yet made an actual project, because I am afraid that something will break and burn down my house. But since I have so much fun with it, I think I am ready to take a shot and I though I might ask the opinion of people who have more experience than me. So here is the idea (it is quite simple actually).

**The project:** I want to use my TV remote to turn on a lamp on my living room.

**What I have done so far:** I've made a prototype using an Arduino UNO, a relay, an IR Receiver and a breadboard. It works. The relay is connected to a power strip in which two desk lamps are plugged. Each desk lamp has a 9w led lamp in it. The relay module is rated at 10A 125VAC. So far, I've made it work, but only as a prototype.

**What I want to do:** Instead of using an Arduino UNO, I was thinking about using a Digispark USB Development Board ([http://digistump.com/products/1](http://digistump.com/products/1)). It is smaller and cheaper. I've researched a bit and I found out the the only downside of the Attiny85 is that it can not handle the irRemote.h library, but that is OK, I've worked my code around this limitation (I tested it on a simulation and apparently it works - [Simulation](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/308266616218452545)).

**Here are my questions:**

**1) How do I power it?:** So far I'm powering my prototype using the USB of my computer. But I was thinking about 9v power supply. Connect to the ground and Vin pins of the Digispark using a power jack. I've only worked with a breadboard and the USB as a power supply. I'm very insecure about this.

**2) How do I power the components?:** I though about using the v5 pin and ground pin on the Digispark to power both the relay and IR Receiver. Is this a good ideia?

**3) How do I do the wiring?:** I have a fairly good ideia of how the circuit works. But so far, I have only made circuits using a breadboard. What is the best way of doing circuits for this project?

**4) How do I encase the project?:** I though about putting everything inside a plastic box. Should I worry about overheating components? Or is it OK to just put it inside a box? Can I use hot glue to fix the components in place?

**5) Should I improve my code?:** I've made this code ([https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/308266616218452545](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/308266616218452545)) to turn the lights on and off. In the simulation, I don't use a relay, but the code is basically the same with a led light instead.

**6) Am I overlooking something?:** I appreciate any kind of suggestion.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much! I hope I can share my finished project here soon."
arduino,Which Led strips should I use?,"For a project I'm working on I need 3 led strips that will be controlled by an arduino.

arduino,ModbusMaster.h,"Hello everyone! It happened to me that one of our college’s partner had requested for communication with Schneider Conext Insight Home module by Arduino for further development! We are using a 3 wires RS485 to TTL MAX485 module to talk with Schneider device in a fashion of Master/ Slave (as Arduino is Master). 
Since I am new with converting RS485 to serial, the code from Github appears to have instructions like this:

node.begin(id, Serialx);
Serialx.readHoldingregister(address, len);

My questions are:
1/ Regarding the “id” part, does it mean that the id of slave device!? Since I know that RS485 allows maximum of 247 slave devices. Is it automatically assigned or it has to be manually configured!?

2/ Regarding the “len”, does it mean that we will start to read from the stated address to the “len” address!?

arduino,FTDI USB to Bluetooth,"Hey folks, I have a device with a serial interface that exposes an FTDI USB port. I'd like to make this wireless over Bluetooth as a serial device and would appreciate some pointers. If it exposed the actual serial interface I believe this would be a pretty simple project (there are already Serial to Bluetooth repeater devices), but I'd like to avoid modifying this device as it is fairly expensive.

How might I create a device that takes a USB input (from the FTDI) and converts it back into a serial interface? I'm fairly new to the Arduino ecosystem. My understanding though is that I'd need an Arduino (Due perhaps?) that acts as a USB host, and a standard Bluetooth module. What I'm really unclear on is if there are libraries to bridge the gap from serial to FTDI USB.

I've been fiddling with getting some emulators working on Arduino but for the most part they're either too low level (I'm looking to step through opcodes at ~1Hz and so dealing with something that asks for how many cycles or T states to run isn't ideal) or they're too big.

ArduZ80 comes up but that is an extremely incomplete and ultra buggy implementation of less than half the instruction set. I've tried a few others (Marat Fayzulin's from 2002 before he went to cycle-step was too big; z80emu and Manuel Sainz de Baranda y Goñi/'redcode' is cycle step and needs the Zeta header lib which was a pain to try and convert to something avr-friendly).

arduino,74HC595N weird behavior,"I just wanted to preface this with the fact that I have been teaching myself how to wire and program Arduinos for about a week. So I apologize if I get any terminology wrong. I don't think this is technically Arduino specific, but that's the platform I'm using. I did test it with the vanilla shiftOut, but I don't like using shiftOut because I don't like black box functions and it does not change how anything performs. Finally, I am an experienced programmer in general, but this is my first time using any C language.

I am trying to control a 4-digit display using the 74HC595 as well as an Arduino UNO. Everything is working, except for one strange quirk. Whenever the most significant bit is a 1 the number doesn't display except for a fraction of a second prior to the next number being displayed.

So what happens is that it displays 1...2...3...4...\_...\_...7... skipping 5 and 6. The way I have it wired means that B (top right) is the first segment connected to Q0 on the chip. If test using MSBFIRST, I get nonsense, but the same thing happens. Anything that ends in one is blank.

Does anyone have any insight as to why this might be happening or how to better troubleshoot it? I tried connecting the loop to a button in order to control the timing a bit better and maybe see any other strange behavior, but that did not change the outcome. I don't think showing my wiring will help since everything else is working perfectly and it's even flashing 5 and 6 very briefly. This leads me to believe it's some sort of timing/overflow issue.

Any help is appreciated!

arduino,"Piezo buzzer acting funny, anybody know why?","In this project I’m working on code for a tune played on a piezo. It works perfectly independently when I run the code in its own Arduino ide project, but when I use the same code in a project that plays the tune after ten LEDs light up, the buzzer continues with a very faint buzz.

A few things to mention, I haven’t set up the buzzer as pinMode(pin,OUTPUT); when I tried that it has the faint buzzing before the tune even plays. The tune plays with tone() and ends with noTone(). Like I said the code seems to work fine on it’s own, but not when I use it along with the LEDs.

I’m aware it’s difficult to give any suggestions without seeing any code. I don’t have any GitHub account set up, but I can set one up if that’s the easiest way to find the problem.

Button2 and Button3 are for moving up and down the menu.  
Button4 is for going a step back, ie, if the user is in a submenu, it opens up the menu. If the user is in menu, it takes back to the homepage that said ""Press Button 1"".

Now, what i wish to implement is, each item in submenu, when selected using Enter Button, displays a text (*I will be writing small messages for her in each submenu, If this text can me animated in some form that would be great, like, 2 lines of message appear and the after 300ms, the continuation of that message appears.*)  
And once the message is complete, the submenu opens up again automatically.  
and the user can again interact using buttons, whether to select the same option again or go up or down or go back in menu and select another item there.

If the code given on the site is suffeicient, then please tell me what things i need to tweak in order to get the implementation i want.  
I know this is a bit lazy of me to not do this on my own but trust me, i have tried many times, and due to my limited knowledge in coding i cant do this by myself. Please Help. Anniversary on 20th Sept.

My plans to also do current sensing on the motor as a means of tracking the gearbox state so I can do digitally controlled semi, auto and burst modes, artificial delays to match rate of fire to real world weapons and round counting.

I’ve been struggling with the mosfet side for too long now so any help is appreciated. I’d love to open source this project too as an easier diy platform for airsoft modders too.

TLDR; mosfet design as used in video burns out, need better mosfet and driver suggestions for airsoft motor / gearbox"
arduino,How can I get 2D position data in a space? (no boundaries or obstacles),"I want to get 2D data (XY coordinates) of a moving body inside a confined rectangular empty space of about 5x5 meters. This won't be a robot but a human performer wearing the sensor so I don't need obstacle or boundary recognition. I considered using a Kinect but the space I need is larger than the the space suggested for a Kinect.  

I found the DFRobot Beetle BLE which looks like the perfect candidate since its small and supports Bluetooth. But when it comes to choosing the sensors to get the data needed I am a bit stuck.

Would an IMU sensor work or should I combine it with a GPS? Or would a GPS be an overkill for such a small space? Or are there any other sensors that would work for my application?

If an IMU (or/and GPS) is needed, having never programmed an IMU (or/and GPS), would the algorithms to get location data be complicated? Could you kindly guide me to some resources so I can achieve what I need.

Thanks in advance."
arduino,NTAG215 emulation via arduino,"I’m looking to for a way to facilitate NFC communication from iOS/android without having to go through all the certifications that each platform require for their wallet platforms via emulating a writable NFC tag and parsing the incoming write from a mobile with an arduino chip so I can send small messages from the iOS/android app to my terminal system.

Unfortunately this googlesphere is full of people who just don’t want to pay for amiibos so it’s really hard to see if anyone has successfully made a NFC tag emulation system to accept writes. 

Has anyone done this? Is it possible?

Cheers :)"
arduino,Should I even try?,"I have been trying some basic things with the NodeMCU and its ability to automate stuff (just as a hobby). I automated some general stuff like lights and fans. I have achieved the same using various options like Rpi (as a server), firebase (as a server), and also NodeMCU as a server, and the client-side was custom-coded app (android).

Now I was trying to think of a way where I could simply have a NodeMCU, a Router, and an app to switch on/off light or fan while keeping all the devices in sync. By which I mean that if I switch ON light on say mobile 1 then it should sync to all of the devices which are connected to the same router, and also if a new user connects to the router then he is in sync with the current state of the appliances.

Now the thing is that I am not sure about its possibility and if someone could help me with the logic or approach to achieve this then it would be of great help."
arduino,Need help converting LiquidCrystal to LiquidCrystal_I2C,"  

Hi All

i am attempting to build this project:

[https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Rework-Station/](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Rework-Station/)

it's my first ever look into the world of Arduino (aside from a clone 3D printer that uses a Arduino controller but that's more ""here use this and upload it"" style)

my problem is the LCD i have is a I2C (4 pins) not a Parallel one (lots of pins like in the pictures), i have gotten it to work with a test Sketch and it displays fine so it's not a wiring issue

the address is the standard 0x27 (found using the port scanner sketch)

i am using the library LiquidCrystal I2C by Frank de Brabander (as specified in one of the walkthroughs: [https://www.makerguides.com/character-i2c-lcd-arduino-tutorial/](https://www.makerguides.com/character-i2c-lcd-arduino-tutorial/). this is also where i got the test Sketch)

the problem is that the Sketch in the project uses the parallel style interface and i haven’t got a clue as to how to convert it across (it doesn't help that there is no wireing diagram in the project :/)

   
 i have tried replacing the lines

\#include &lt;LiquidCrystal.h&gt;

LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2);

with

\#include &lt;LiquidCrystal\_I2C.h&gt;

LiquidCrystal\_I2C lcd(0x27, 20, 4);

(This was the most accurate one i could find but i did try many other things, most of which wouldn’t compile)

but aside from that i am at a loss (don’t get me wrong i have spent ages trying to find out what i need to do and it's looking more and more like i will need to learn how to program in Arduino and start from scratch)

   
 

any chance someone could take a look at it for me and either point me in the right direction or change it and explain why those changes needed to be made?

arduino,AtMega328p standalone PCB,"Hey guys,

Could somebody please do a quick review of this schematics? It's a custom pcb board where I had to replace STM32 uC for AtMega due to market shortage. I have never designed AtMega boards, so It's possible I missed something.

It will be programmed with Atmel ICE via mosi/miso/sck/rst pins.

Thanks!

arduino,24V Reed Switch,"I have an industrial 24V reed switch for a pneumatic cylinder and was wondering if and how I could wire it for use with an Arduino.  I've found drawings showing just a basic reed switch wired with one side connected to 5V through a 1k ohm relay, with that side also connected to a digital pin as an input, while the other side just goes to ground.  This switch operates at 24V.  So would I use the same setup, but substituting 24V for 5V?  Or would that burn it up?  Would I need a higher-value resistor, or...?  Help."

Does that mean it's like a relay, where it will interrupt continuity between the black and white if it senses something?  How would you wire this to an Arduino?"

I currently have a Logitech driving force gt, which simply wasn't good enough for me. I have a 600w 36v DC brushed motor I'll be working with. Anyhow, I was wondering, I've noticed everyone making their custom wheels uses the Arduino Leonardo, I have an Uno laying around, pin wise there seems to be no difference. So I was wondering whether I'd be able to just take the same code and slap it into the Uno."
arduino,LED dimming difference caused by PWM voltage difference,"Hello.

I have a MEGA board and a Due board.

using n-mosfet(IRLML2502) to control LED brightness.

When using MEGA, the brightness of the LED can be adjusted to the maximum level.

But with DUE, the LED brightness is about half.

I know MEGA is 5v and DUE supplies 3.3v.

Having trouble running mosfet with 3.3v PWM signal?

I'm looking for a Due or Teensy4 for faster performance, but I'm stuck with this issue.

arduino,What's the easiest way to input wifi password?,"My system consists of 2 device, the main console which is an arduino has to connect to the user wifi network, I am selling this product so the user has to do it manually after shipping. I already have a small oled screen in my setup, should I just use a knob to go trough the letters and numbers and then 2 buttons for ""next"" and ""ok"" 

I really dont want to use a full size keyboard because this is a one time task. 

My second question would it be possible to store that password internally without uploading any code to the arduino? My goal is the data submitted should persist even if the device go off for some reason. I haven't done any research on this to be honest but I believe it should be doable

Thanks for reading"

I've been trying to play around with two Uno Wifi Rev 2s trying to get them to talk to each other over WIFI, trying to get a button on one to turn off/on an LED bulb on the other.  


I've mostly been watching tutorials and cannibalizing code together but haven't managed to get it to work yet. If anyone could help that would be really great thanks in advance!

arduino,True noob needs help with pro micro wiring and eventual coding - controller inputs.,"I'm extremely hopeful I don't annoy some die hard arduino sub redditor who believes 3 seconds on google could answer these questions, I'm really this dumb! 

So I bought this pro micro years ago for a race sim project i had which i quickly realised was overkill for the project at hand which was just buttons so used a zero delay.

I've dug it out as I'm making a hotas throttle/button box combo and starting to feel a bit out of my depth here. I'm keen to learn but what I'm coming across doesn't quite point me in the right direction. 

My project consists of 2 toggle switches. 15 momentary switches. 1 10k slide potentiometer and 1 controller joystick which has 5 pins on the board it is mounted on. 

From my searches, I feel I have a rudimentary understanding of how this matrix wiring works but I basically don't grasp the fundamentals here to  understand how I would wire all this together. 

Am I better to find a matrix layout for the momentary/toggles and the push button on the joystick and then wire the pot and stick separately? 

Do the remaining 3 pins just go to any random pins on the board? 

Is there any resource someone could point me to where all of this stuff is ELI5? I'm really hoping to learn more about electronics in doing this beyond the simple red to red black to black that's got me by so far. 

And I don't suppose i could be pointed in the direction of an AIO library of coding for controller inputs? 

I'm truly hopeful that there's an existing document where I just have to 1 and 0 or true and false the inputs I want or is this going to be even more of a headache? 

Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks in advance if you're feeling patient and helpful!"
arduino,What's your preferred alternative to the Arduino IDE and what's a good guide on using it?,"About a year ago I started programming for the first time ever, and it was using the Arduino IDE. Since then I've taken a few codecademy courses on C/C++ which provide a web based IDE. 

In my brief studies, it looks like everything else to write code in, Arduino or not, involves having a few programs open and it all gets esoteric very fast. To be honest, I'm easily overwhelmed, and by that same token the inability to fold code blocks in the Arduino IDE also scrambles me very quickly. 

Sooner or later it will be necessary to use another IDE, so it might as well be now. What are some IDEs that are Arduino compatible that you recommend, and can you provide me with any tutorials on how to use them? Thanks!"

Think the Fifth Element but you don't need a match.

I'm thinking I'll have to have 4 readers but can I even connect 4 to one arduino and have them all work at the same time? 

Or will I have to use 4 Nanos with either nrf24l01 or blue tooth to communicate with a master that controls lock once all 4 have been placed correctly?

Or am I stupid and there is a much easier way or anything that won't work? Any help is appreciated."
arduino,I need basic help finding hardware to control five magnets,"Hello all,

First of all, this is going to be annoying ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" level of questions, so I apologize in advance. I'm super new to Arduino, but I think for what I'm planning to do it's a good choice. Basically, I want to move things at pseudo-random times. It's just an ""on/off"" movement and it should be pretty quick, so I think electronic magnets plus levers is my best bet. 

It's five 24v electronic magnets that I just want to turn on and off. Individually preferred, but I'd be ok with controlling them simultaneously or in groups, if five is too many to address at once. Total draw of the magnets will be around 40W or 1.7A.

I guess I need some type of relay(s), which is what I'm looking for right now. Or would a mosfet be the right choice here? If yes, could you guys point me towards what to look for and what else would I need? I'm fine with soldering basic stuff, if that's relevant, but frankly, I'd prefer plug-and-play solutions, if there are any.

TL;DR:

* What hardware do I need to make an Arduino Nano move five 24V magnets (""plug-and-play"" preferred)?
* Can someone point me towards specific models/types of HW?
* Ideally, is there a wiring diagram for the HW?

arduino,Inputs and voids as some kind of string?,"Hi all. 

Say I have a button, switch, and light defined as B1, S1, L1. The main loop debounces the button and if the state changes, runs void zone1(), and all is well.

&amp;#x200B;

So I assume it's capable of switching up to at least 230V and in some cases 400V (not sure the difference or what those designations mean).  But does it need to have current applied in order to have continuity between the output contacts?  Or is it bad?  Or is there something I'm missing?"
arduino,Voltage drop calculation help,"Hey there

I have a set of actuators setup to lower/raise a desk. I’ve tapped into one of them by directing the signal sent wire into a voltage divider (64ohm and 12ohm with 4.7uf capacitor) then to A0 on a Due. I’ve also implemented code to smooth the analogRead values due to the amount of noise created when the actuators activate. I get a consistent reading of 118. 

I’m wanting to detect the voltage drop and to get a 117 reading, for example, from A0, I basically have to be under the desk pushing full force with my body. The actuators are a bit overkill, rated for 300kgs each and require 24V. I know that a Due’s A0 pin only does 0-1023 values and likes 3.3V, but is there a way to scale this up to decrease the amount of resistance required to cause a drop? 

I was successful doing this with a smaller actuator (24VDC rated for only ~25kg), being able to measure my hand pushing on the lifting rod."

Everything works, except it turns back to 0 degrees after a second, while I don't have that specified anywhere. Can somebody explain me what is happening in the code?","I wrote/took the following code from a tutorial:

```
#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;

I don't think I need to post the circuit because it works correctly. Whenever I enter a value in the serial monitor, like 180, it turns to 180 but one second after it turns back to 0. Why? Does it read a 0 from the serial? I tried to do a check if the read is 0 then don't do anything but that didn't work. Does the variable reset? How do I make it stay in one place?"

arduino,How long can I space out the lights in a WS2812B LED strip without resistance problems?,"I have a WS2812B programmable LED strip that I would like to cut up into its individual LED lights and space them out, soldering wires in between each unit.  There would be about 4-5 inches of wire between each LED.  I measured out the expected path in my project, and with the additional wiring the 70 LEDs would run to about 28-30 feet long.  I worry that the lights at the end of the strand will not work due to the added resistance of the wires.  Is there a way to determine if this setup will work before I take the time to do all of that cutting and soldering?  If necessary, I could split it into multiple shorter strands, but that's obviously going to require additional logic and pins in the Arduino to manage them. Thanks."

A cheap multimeter says it's 5V at the arduino, and at the end of the cable connecting the arduino to the driver. 

However, when I power on the driver, I get no rotation on the motor - UNTIL I test the voltage with the multimeter again, anywhere between the arduino and the driver. Now it shows 2.5V and the motor spins as I'd expect.

The thing is, something bizarre it's happening, when I power it through the 5v pin on Arduino and the Arduino is powered by the USB it works completely fine, but if I power my Arduino with a 12v/2a power source it doesn't send any response to my ESP32, I've tried also powering it directly with this power source since it supports 24V tops and nothing.

arduino,Best way to get distance measurement of potentially obscured object?,"Hi,

I was just kind of brainstorming about a potential project that would involve measuring the distance of an object and was wondering the best way to go about this? I've googled a bit and I guess Bluetooth signal strength can be used (somewhat) as a proxy for distance however it can easily be messed up if there are things in the way. If the object I wanted the distance of had some sort of tracker apparatus or Wifi or clock, how would I best go about finding its distance (accurate to hopefully within 1 foot with a range of up to 20 feet).



I also pondered some sort of echo location/aucoustic tracking where the object could maybe measure the time it takes for a tone to reach it? Do you see any limitations to this or know of any good sensors that could achieve this. My napkin calculations show for acoustic location to be accurate enough to a foot, I would need a clock on it that is accurate to milliseconds."

So I have been trying to wirelessly communicate between arduinos using NRF24L01 Modules. I am trying to send values from one arduino nano to the other arduino nano so it can use them to control servos. When I try to send the values, the mega chip on the receiving arduino heats up to 1st degree burn levels. However, if I turn off the transmitting arduino, the receiving arduino cools back down again. The receiving arduino is also only receiving the value of 0 and that is only what appears on the serial monitor. The receiving arduino doesn't register any other value. Does anyone have any clue about what could be wrong? I've checked the code and the previous code I based it off of worked after some time of me having the same problem above.

In parallel I have the +/- of the battery also connected a Comidox boost converter ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L76KLRY](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L76KLRY)) which is connected to the 5V terminal on an Arduino Nano.

I ran my device all afternoon in the sun and it ran for 5-6 hours before it died.  When I checked the battery I measured 0.33 V so it seems the battery almost completely discharged and wasn't charged by the charging board as intended.  The device uses 70 mA most of the time and then every minute it takes a picture and saves it to an SD card and that ups the current draw for a few seconds, but on average I believe it draws less than 100 mA.

There is an output +/- on the charging board and not sure if I should connect my device there or directly to the battery as I am doing?  Also not sure if I need some kind of Schottky diode for the solar panel or if the charging board takes care of that?  Last thing I wonder may be an issue is that I tried to find some documentation regarding the charging board and the max input voltage is 8V.  I know the solar panel is 6V, but I thought I had read that the max voltage of solar panels are higher than the spec 6V it listed.

Any help or pointing towards resources is always much appreciated as I try to figure everything out, thanks! :)"

arduino,How can I report the position of stepper motor without disturbing their motion," TLDR: I use ESP8266’s to drive stepper motors, but sending the position back to the server causes the motors to make audible noise for a step or two.

Hello fellow tinkerers. For a completely custom large scale wall plotter project, I want to drive stepper motors quite fast over big distances. Also, I want to have near real time feedback of the motor positions e.g. 4x per second mainly for visualization.

But this is where it gets tricky.

Originally, I had one stepper motor, one TMC2209 stepper driver and one Esp8266 D1 Mini NodeMcu per side, and the sides got their settings as well as their positions via wifi using websockets, which they also used to report their positions back to the server.

Driving the motors with no feedback over serial works great at any speed, but as soon as I turn on wifi, the stepper motors stopped running smoothly. Especially when going fast, noticeable missed steps and vibration are hearable at a frequency of 5 to 10 per second. I assume that this is due to occasional networking stuff using up too much processing power and the stepper.run() does not get called when its due and therefore the motors start to stutter. To avoid this problem, I started using a second Esp8266 D1 Mini NodeMcu per side. One only for wifi and json parsing, the other one only to drive the stepper motor. But these two need to communicate nonetheless. Therefore I tried connecting both via I2C, which caused occasional lost bits. This was unacceptable since I cannot have the bot moving to a wrong position. The same was the case for the SPI link between both microcontrollers. Then I started using SoftwareSerial to transfer information between them. Receiving is fine, but while sending data over the SoftwareSerial, the motors stutter again… This time only as often as I report the position, but I don’t want the motors to stutter at all…

How can I get past this? What did I miss? How are other microcontrollers driving multiple stepper motors without any stuttering issues at all."

arduino,How do I create 2 threads in the Ardunio IDE?,"So here is the situation, I am creating an Ardunio project where part of it sends data recordings to an SD card. My problem, is that my SD card is having the time and data values written onto it every 3 seconds. However, the LCD screen where I am also writing these values is being affected by this 3 second delay. So even though I am recording these values every 3 seconds onto the SD card, it is also effecting what I print onto the LCD screen (because what I want to print onto the LCD screen is dependent on a joystick and so the delay is affecting the speed of this LCD screen.) Does anyone have any idea on how I could solve this problem?

arduino,Why are one of my LED Matrices fully lit? (instead of displaying a number),"I'm using an Arudino Uno, and four MAX7219 IC LED Matrices (they look like [this](https://imgur.com/a/JbHmszG).

As for the circuit, DIN, CS, and CLK are connected to digital pins 2, 3, 4 respectively, while the rest of the matrices are chained together with female-female wires. VCC is connected to the 5V pin on the arduino. GND is connected to ground.

All of the matrices seem to be working fine except for the last one in the chain, sometimes it seems to be fully on sometimes (every led diode on full power), and other times only some of them are (randomly) on. Is this a connection issue, is the matrix broken, or is something wrong with the code?"

While I am a decent builder, programming is not my strong suit. I can somewhat follow the logic in the two separate codes but I am having trouble converting the pitch shift functionality from the uno + wave shield to the nano + dfplayer mini. Both builds have the ability to sample audio from a mic and play it over a speaker. Both builds also have the ability to play sound files off an sd card. While the pitch shifter by default uses a potentiometer to set the value of the shift, it also has the ability to simply set the value in code so the pot is not needed. The ability to play sound effects from an sd card is nice but not required for my purpose.

arduino,Rotary Encoder to measure length of wire pulled from a spool.,"I am trying to rig up a device that would measure the length of a wire that is being pulled from a spool. 

My first thought was to use a rotary Encoder. The wire would be pulled between to wheels. The axle of one wheel would be attached to the rotary Encoder. The other wheel would strictly be for tension to keep the wire against the wheel that is attached to the rotary Encoder.

Then I would just keep track of each time the rotary Encoder make a full 360 turn.

So X numbers of turns on the encoder = Y feet of wire.

The biggest problem that I can see with this idea is de bouncing the encoder if I use a mechanical rotary Encoder.

Any thoughts? Is a rotary Encoder a good way to go or would there be a better sensor?"

I am also powering the Arduino Uno from the USB port which is connected to my laptop.

Does anyone know what is happening here? Is there some kind of memory overflow?"

arduino,Help with measuring battery voltages below 3.3V on itsybitsy m4 (SAMD51),"So the microcontroller is running on a lithium ion battery and I would like to monitor its voltage. It’s runs using a 3.3v regulator, so when the battery voltage drops to 3.0 volts, so does the reference voltage and so no longer reads properly. Is there a software solution for this issue? I assumed changing to the internal 2.23V vref would work but it seems that also doesn’t work when the input voltage drops. Any help would be awesome. Thanks!"
arduino,Using the Sparkfun lis3dh on low power mode,"Hey all! I'm very new to using arduinos, but im hoping to wire on a sparkfun lis3dh accelerometer to my arduino MKR-GSM-1400. 

If I follow this guide (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lis3dh-hookup-guide) I could wire the arduino up using i2c (I might ignore the stuff going to the ADC as its optional). I'm correct in thinking that while the MKR1400 has a 5V input, the output and board is at 3.3V, so I will not need a level shifter?

My main question is how to access the lis3dh's low power mode. I can see from this (https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/9/6/LIS3DH_AppNote_DocID_18198rev1.pdf), that the low power mode is located at CTRL_REG1[3]. 

In the low level example in the github (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LIS3DH_Arduino_Library/blob/master/examples/LowLevelExample/LowLevelExample.ino) there is notation to change up the registers. I'm not as up to speed with lower-level programming/ understanding of hex as I used to be! Could anyone please help me understand what I would have to write to switch CTRL_REG1[3] to low power mode? Also, do I need to write something to CTRL_REG4[3] to definitely switch of normal power mode? Thanks!"

I'm using a Pololu Dual Motor Shield MC33926 ([https://www.pololu.com/product/2503/resources](https://www.pololu.com/product/2503/resources)) with Arduino Uno R3. I wired the whole system and tested my code by powering the shield through the Arduino (5V) and everything worked fine. Now I want to power the shield with a 12V power source which will drive my DC motors. When I connect my DC power source to the Shield (same connection as when I tested my code) the Shield doesn't power up. I'm definitely getting 12V at the connections. I've tried multiple 12V power sources.  
Any clue as to why the shield isn't powering up? or how to diagnose what's happening?

arduino,"Character strings: How much is too much, when to use PROGMEM","My current project involves using several hundred (maybe 300-ish) character strings at a length of 3 - 4 characters each. I figure that this will fill up my RAM pretty quickly and opted to look at the PROGMEM tutorial on the Arduino site. 

Looking through this tutorial, it appears that using PROGMEM is easy enough. As with most things in life however, my particular use case requires additional steps. Character strings must first be stored as individual character arrays, \*then\* stored as a table in program memory, called later with a few special functions. The way they're put in the table is as follows: 

    const char string_0[] PROGMEM = ""String 0"";   // ""String 0"" etc are strings to store - change to suit.
    const char string_1[] PROGMEM = ""String 1"";
    const char string_2[] PROGMEM = ""String 2"";
    const char string_3[] PROGMEM = ""String 3"";
    const char string_4[] PROGMEM = ""String 4"";
    const char string_5[] PROGMEM = ""String 5"";
    
    // Then set up a table to refer to your strings.
    
    const char* const string_table[] PROGMEM = {string_0, string_1, string_2, string_3, string_4, string_5};

It's this part in particular that will be absolutely mindnumbing to do, considering the number of individual strings I have to account for. 

I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way to store large numbers of strings in program memory, perhaps a trick that you've done personally. Any help is appreciated, just looking for additional advice before sinking hours into this. Thanks!"
arduino,Flickering on shift register,"Hey guys

Thought it would be fun to manually send data to a shift register however I’ve noticed that I’m getting flickering and having lights turn on or off what feels randomly as I mess with terminals to try to ensure my $10 3-18v power supply was correctly connected to the breadboard.

Thoughts on why it would be doing this? A direct 5v + resistor + led results in expected outcome so the power is on and working it’s just the shift register that’s not happy. Could it be the power supply isnt smoothing the 5v enough and causing my serial/clock lines to get what it thinks is rapid input on one or all the buttons I have hooked up?

Also was planning on using a arduino to send serial + the two clock commands tomorrow night but I think that 8 led might be pushing onboard 5v so can I put my 5v power supply on the vcc/ground and put the 3 signal wires on my arduino? Or does the voltage/amps of the vcc need to match the signal and clock? Should be fine right?

Here’s the wiring from the circuit in question https://i.imgur.com/7Q3CRik.jpg and the data sheet for my shift register https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/scls041i/scls041i.pdf?ts=1629610306620&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F

**MyButton** enhances push-buttons' behavior with:
- Multiple behaviors in a single button (given a list of ""periods"", it returns, upon release, which of these periods the button have been pressed for)
- Progress of a push towards a set period in a custom number of steps (given a period (say 3000 ms), and a number of steps equal to 6, the function would report the step it's in each 500ms) -&gt; provided an example with a progress bar in a SSD1306 OLED display. 
- Basic debouncing and event detection (both falling and rising edge)
- Timed press (gives the time since a button was pressed in micros/millis/seconds)

And all these functionalities work in a non-blocking manner.

arduino,Arduino's matrix are so........ quirky (With tips kinda hard to search in internet),"I know that work like the C matrix but, trust me, they're not only quirky, but evil. Here are the things I discovered, that, for me, a 99% autodidact person, were hard to search or discover.

**1-The 128 curse:**

So I was trying to make the largest matrix possible, and i ran into the struggle. In some numbers the IDE said to me that the matrix was just too large. **I found that for values &lt;= 127 it worked just right, but with values &gt;= 128 arduino didn't accepted the matrix for its dimensions.** Now, the point here is: 

The sketch itself didn't even surpass the 2% of the arduino Mega 2560 storage capacity, and the variables not even the 5%. I would find pretty logic that the limit was due to some kind of ""problematic number"" (such as surpassing the 256 in the 16 bits videogames (16\*16 = 256) but i didn't fins anything at all about the 127 and 128 multiplications................................. 

**Avoid at all cost surpass the 127. If you deadly need to make a larger matrix (just like me) do several matrix and one smaller matrix to go upon the others.** Ej: If you have 4 matrix, do a fifth one, a 2\*2 simple matrix. In left-to -right and up-to-down store ""1,2,3,4"". Then, make comparisions to detect if the limit of the current matrix is reached. If it is, now store the data in the other matrix. How? doing X and Y variables for the matrix-of-matrixs and increasing or decreasing the value of the X and Y variables to get to the in-matrix you need. That get me to the next point:

**2-X and Y are spinned. It hurts to the eyes.**

**The X and Y are spinned. my\_matrix\[Y\]\[X\]**

I am a very ""habits person"" so the fact that for refering to the intersection between the third row and the second column you must type `my_matrix [3][2]` it's just horryfing. **Here it's better explained:** ([https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino\_multi\_dimensional\_arrays.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_multi_dimensional_arrays.htm))

That's all, don't fall in the traps of the matrix."
arduino,How do you read a single pin woth port manipulation?,"I'm trying to read digital pin 7 by it self with port manipulation. I've tried using PIND7 but it just give me the vaule at the end. So that returns 7 while PIND2 would return 2 instead of the vaule of its bit.

arduino,I need some tips on how I can make a code that displays the temperature readings from an LM35DZ using a 74HC595 shift register and a four digit seven segment display,"This is a project I've been working on for a while now. I have a barebones Arduino Uno hooked up to a shift register and LM35DZ temperature sensor, which then will allow me to read the analog signals from the LM35DZ and convert them into temperature in degrees Celsius. The shift register is there to control a four digit seven segment display, with the purpose of displaying the temperature readings. I have gotten an understanding of how the shift register works, and have managed to count from 0-9 on the four digit seven segment display using the shift register, that's all. I would love your tips and ideas on how I can display the temperature readings on the display, as I am personally having a hard time progressing. You can see my code so far [here](https://codeshare.io/K8j0xK).

arduino,WIFI UDP REMOTE LED PANEL 64x32 with 8266,"&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/p8rpbv/video/5b9nbxbrtpi71/player

after i made a wall clock, i did an experiment to stream full images from windows to the 8266 nodemcu.

Future goal is to have a full featured wall clock, but using a windows server behind to do all the possible stuff on it with some graphics too.

I choose UDP, so its blind, not-syncronized, not-granted image delivery. Each frame is 6k of integers. At the moment there is no ack from the 8266.

For clocks i do a refresh every second, for temperature every 30 seconds. For bubblebobble sprites its 130ms interval, for kateupton (which is full color even if subject is b/w) managed to push 80ms interval

on a regular 54mbit wifi it does perform pretty ok.. just sometimes it slows down and then speeds up later to catch up (did not try streaming over internet yet)

The 8266 (flashed at 160mhz) do store every frame in the PxMatrix.h buffer, so last frame is constantly visible on screen, even if connection is missing.

Host windows program is written in [vb.net](https://vb.net)."
arduino,Monitoring mains voltage question,"Hi, I'm attempting to use an Arduino to monitor a 240v supply. This will then trigger the action (opening an iris for the bathroom fan). 

For safety, I'm using a phone charger to step down the voltage prior to monitoring.  When I turn on the system the input is correctly reading 1023, however when it turns off the value doesn't go back to zero. It flicks around random values and can be zero or 1023.

I'm monitoring by just connecting the live output from the charger to an analogue pin on the arduino

There is obviously something simple that I am missing. Has anyone come across this before. Thanks."

arduino,3 component HID not working.,"Fair warning: This is my first project and I vaguely know what I am doing. Also, tbh, don't know if software or hardware issue.

I'm trying to make a custom HID using a joystick and 4x3 keypad\[all components listed and linked at the end\]. The idea being that the joystick controls mouse movement while the keypad can left click, right click, and initiate several TBD macros. 

Unfortunately, it's not working. None of the keys respond and the mouse movements do seem to be prompted by the joystick, but not remotely the right way. Below is the code I wrote. I am super aware of how inelegant and inefficient it is, but right now I just want a working version before I refine and improve it. I'm also adding a diagram of how it's all wired.

My current issue is how to measure the ticking of the clock.  I've kicked around a number of ideas (encoder on the arbor, hall effect sensor on the pendulum, etc) but the current idea involves using a piezo element attached to the frame of the clock to measure the vibration from each tick.  The tick is significant, easily felt just through touch, so I thought this would be fairly simple.  However, my results have been very inconsistent.  Occasionally , I'm able to measure the tick with the setups listed below but it's just not repeatable and I'm not sure where the problem is.

My current hypotheses:

* The ""tick"" just isn't strong enough and my idea of using a peizo element is just flawed.
* It's a frequency problem and I need to find a sensor that resonates near the frequency of the clock frame.
* I'm not using the element correctly (I've never used a piezo for this sort of thing before).

* For testing purposes, I'm using this code and schematic as it's simple and easy to adjust to eliminate variables. [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Knock](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Knock)

What I've tried (all combinations of the following, each combination demonstrated a signal when the sensor was tapped):

* Clock: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/274747559400?chn=ps&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkcid=28](https://www.ebay.com/itm/274747559400?chn=ps&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkcid=28)
* Resistors: 1 megaohm and 10 megaohm  (I tried a few smaller resistors but didn't pursue that line of investigation very far as the sensitivity to even a firm tap seemed to drop off very quickly)
* Piezo:[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10293](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10293)[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9197](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9197)pkm22epp-40 buzzer.
* All elements attached to the brass frame of the clock with a small plastic clip
* Since I seemed to get slightly better results with the buzzer enclosed in a plastic housing, I also tried printing some enclosures for the naked elements but this didn't really seem to make much difference and it introduces a lot of variables that are hard to control.  However, I can print or machine any parts that I need to.  I should note that the effects are so inconsistent that I'm not sure I'm actually measuring the tick or if it's just experimental error.

Any ideas where I'm going wrong?  Is this a worthwhile line of investigation or should I cut my losses and just go for the hall effect sensor. I know a hall effect sensor will work but it will make the actual assembly of the clock a bit more tricky as the positioning of the pendulum will have to be much more tightly constrained.  The piezo element can just go wherever it needs to.

arduino,Control of a Synchronous AC Generator Using Arduino,"This note is to ask for guidance on the best way to proceed with this project. I have a paragraph outlining the mechanical hardware runs, my view of the main issues and a listing of item that I am concerned with.

Background

The single phase synchronous generator is driven by a diesel driving a 6 pole synchronous ac machine at a speed of 1200 rpm. Speed control is achieved through an internal governor built into the fuel injection pump. DC current is applied to the rotating field of the machine (armature) through two slip rings on the machine shaft. Source of the DC is from a DC generator coaxial with the synchronous generator shaft. Synchronous machine AC voltage (220 V) is controlled by the level of DC current through the slip rings. DC current is variable to meet synchronous generator output voltage as the AC load changes. Manipulation of the field current in the DC machine alters the current that enters through the slip rings of the AC machine.

Control Hardware

I anticipate using a ZMPT101B board to reduce the 220 volt to a level that can be used as an input to the Arduino. The field current of the DC machine (nominal 0.3 amps 26 volts DC) and hence the output ac voltage can be controlled through the use of a power transistor that can handle these values.  

Questions

A – Need a suggestion of the best Arduino model to use since I have to input the analog control voltage from ZMPT101B and I have to output 10 – 20 ma to the power transistor.

B – Looks like PID control will be needed to take the input controlled variable of 220 volts AC and adjust output current to hold the voltage as the synchronous machine load changes. I do not think that proportional only mode would work. Like suggestions on  code to achieve the PID mode.

For large writes, it’s simple, you begin the transmission, loop while performing Wire.write() and check it’s return value. When I returns 0, i.e. no bytes were written, the buffer is full so you do a Wire.endTransmission(false) which sends everything in the buffer without sending the stop bit, then you advance the register location you are writing to, and start a new transmission. Loop until the whole thing is sent. Easy enough, if annoying. But I am not sure how a similar approach could be taken with reading? Should I just request 32 bytes at a time advancing the read location each time until the full data is read?"

arduino,3 Stepper motors 1 Arduino,"Hello

I have a project, where I have 2 stepper motors powering some gears, and a third stepper motor powering a peristaltic pump. I would also require 2 IR sensors, so that when the laser is broken it will engage my mechanism through 1 rotation. The other sensor is simply to indicate if the cartridge on my machine is empty.

I am relatively new to microcontroller projects, in school we took a control systems and mechatronics class, but it was more theoretical than applicable. I don't know any part numbers or what is compatible with what.

I know a stepper motor requires a driver, and I require an Arduino. The thing is, I am not sure if 1 Arduino could run all of these items. Maybe I could have 1 to run the motors, and another for the sensors. I am not sure how this works. Advice of any kind would be greatly appreciated.

 I also don't really know where to look. I have been searching for parts on SparkFun and AdaFruit."

I’m trying to connect my Jetson Nano B01 with my BLE Sense via UART pins to communicate with each other. I’ve heard that I would need a level shifter so I bought one. My understanding is that Jetson outputs 5v and the BLE Sense receives 3.3V. 

To power my BLE Sense I want to connect it to a portable battery. So I read that I need to solder a bridge on the USB sensors. Would I still need a level shifter between the Jetson and BLE Sense?

arduino,Trying to make a plasma ball effect,
arduino,Question!,"I'm currently writing a code for a steering wheel using a rotary encoder, and I have adjusted this code to work within my game. However, there is one issue that I cannot find a solution to.

Would like to preface by saying sorry for my confusing description, if you need help understanding please ask questions and ill reply ASAP.

Im trying to make the value of the rotary encoder stop at 10,000 (before being mapped) and then if I turn the other way it will instantly start to reduce value again. However, when I turn the encoder over the 10,000 value, it continues to show the value, but still uses a different value(higher). For example, 90 degree rotation = 10,000

100 degree rotation = 12,000

If I rotate the encoder 100 degrees it will show produce a value of 12,000, but it will be constrained to 10,000. This is almost correct. But I would like the value to never go over 10,000. This is because if I turn it 100 degree to the right, I have to turn it 11 degree to the left for it to actually read a 1-degree movement.

I hope this makes sense.

I  tried out with just using two nails and some resistors like [here](http://blog.ringerc.id.au/2012/01/diy-dc-soil-moisture-sensor.html) and tested it with a small tank as a trial. The problem I faced with this design is that regardless of the concentration of salt there is in the water, it always gives me the same reading/value which is similar to having a short between the voltage source and the analogue pin. The goal of the sensor is to have a reading that changes as the concentration of salt increases or decreases in the water over time. The thing is that the water could start with having small amounts of salt and with time the concentration would increase. I plan to use this sensor to trigger opening a water valve that would dispose the water till a certain low threshold of salt concentration is reached, and then the cycle repeats.

Also, I'm not worried about rusting or long term effects from electrolysis because the water is not used for plants or drinking or anything like that. I think the sensor would last long enough before having to change its probes as I'm gonna have its voltage source enabled only when a reading is needed.

Is there a sensor that can do this? Something that can be built easily?"

arduino,Ameba Arduino: [RTL8722CSM] [RTL8722DM] Use MQTT to Upload and Listen to Data," **Preparation**

* Ameba x 1

**Example**

In this example, we connect Ameba to MQTT-Broker. Then send messages as publisher and receive messages from MQTT-Broker as subscriber. Open the MQTT example “File” -&gt; “Examples” -&gt; “AmebaMQTTClient” -&gt; “MQTT\_Basic”.

Please modify some WiFi-related parameters. And some information related to MQTT.

The “mqttServer” refers to the MQTT-Broker, we use the free MQTT sandbox “test.mosquitto.org” for testing. “clientId” is an identifier for MQTT-Broker to identify the connected device. “publishTopic” is the topic of the published message, we use “outTopic” in the example. The devices subscribe to “outTopic” will receive the message. “publishPayload” is the content to be published. “subscribeTopic” is to tell MQTT-broker which topic we want to subscribe to. 

Next, compile the code and upload it to Ameba. Press the reset button, then open the serial monitor. After Ameba is connected to MQTT server, it sends the message “hello world” to “outTopic”. To see the message, we need another MQTT client. Here we use a chrome plugin “MQTTLens” to be the MQTT client. You can find it in google webstore. Install and open the MQTTLens, click “+” next to “Connection” on the left, and fill in the required information

* Connection Name: Used to identify the connection, you can choose a name you like.
* Hostname: The MQTT-Broker server, here we use “iot.eclipse.org”

I designed my own Arduino Nano board with a Buck converter and relays for a side project. I received the board which got assembled by JLCPCB and i am able to power it up via micro usb but i have not been able to program it.

I am using a CH340E as the USB converter. I get a COM port on my computer when i plug it in and the LED for power turns on. I can confirm i am getting voltage to the ATmega328P but it gives me the following error when i try to program:

arduino,Arduino vs Raspberry Pi,"I'm sure this question has come up countless times, but I have yet to find an answer that touches on all the important points for my situation.

For an upcoming hackathon, we have two days to get a working prototype off the ground, and I'm interested in hearing your opinions on how feasible either approach would be.

The overall goal is to create a small portable device which tracks the user's location, figures out the speed at which the device travels (in a car), and plays a sound file based on the speed. For this, I surmise that I'm going to need a Arduino/Pi, battery power source, GPS component, and some kind of small speaker. Am I missing something?

I'm the only developer on the team. I have plenty of (dotnet) development experience but exactly zero experience with Arduinos, RPis and the specific IoT development stack.

We were suggested to use an Arduino, but I'm having second thoughts. Because of my lack of experience and the short time to get the prototype off the ground, I'm worried that the technical entry cost to Arduino is much larger than that of a RPi. Is my suspicion correct?

That's the biggest concern for me, beginner friendliness. In about two working days (one, really, given the second day will be mostly testing, tweaking, and presentation/demo), I'm going to have to learn most of these things from scratch. I've already prepared the basic math process behind it all, but the tech stack is new to me.

**Some basic concerns:**

* Can Arduino/RPi reasonably run off battery power, and what kind of basic battery size would I be looking at for at least an hour's runtime (preferably more)?
* Which is easier to implement a GPS module for?
* I've read that Arduino uses its own language - how feasible is this to implement custom logic?
* Are there CPU concerns with Arduino and having to do relatively complicated math calculation on the fly?
* Does the Arduino have an internal clock I can rely on for timestamps of GPS location readings? I assume the Pi does have one?
* Are there significant budgetary differences?

I would also welcome any additional advice, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with having to make this technical decision with no prior experience."
arduino,How to link tabs in arduino IDE,"Hey guys! 

I have a project that is more or less finished, but I also have a buzzer connected and the main code is a bit far. I then remembered some of the previous projects I have seen there has been a tab in the IDE for configurations. 

How is this done? Or if I make a tab, would that include it's own Setup and Loop? 

The reason that I wanna do this is cause I want the buzzer to play different songs, and one song is a pretty long piece of code that I would like to not have in my main code.. So I would like 2-3 tabs with different songs and in my main code just link to the different tab after what song it should play..

I made a small project with the KX134 accelerometer. I got 3 sensors and all of them show heavy noise with high measurement rates.

With this setup, there is a ""signal"" of +/-0.5 g to +/- 1 g in a more or less quiet place. The setting of the g-range has no influence on this signal.

I would not expect such high interferences in a sensor like this, which ist also used in professional setups. 

So, is this normal? Had someone similar experiences or an idea, what I could have done wrong?

I'm sorry that I'm being so vague, but I have to be hesitant with sharing details until after the due date. I understand that I'll need to make exceptions for those who offer to help, and I'm okay with that.  


Ideally I'd like to share my wiring diagram and have a video meeting over discord or something, I could show you the components in real time or something. I really can't imagine it'd take more than a half-hour or so. If you're electronically savvy and willing to offer some help with this, feel free to dm me, please.

Essentially, I'm using TEGs to generate voltage to power an adafruit feather, which will send a signal. Right now I can create the voltage, and separately I can send a signal using the feathers. The problem is that as of now, when the feather is without power, and then receives it again, it will not automatically begin running my program. Instead, I need to click the reset button, before it starts running. This is an issue because for the purpose of my project, I need it to automatically begin signaling once it has generated enough power. How can I do this? Thanks!"

arduino,ADXL 345: Reading all zeroes as output data,"Hello everyone!

I am attempting to construct a data-logger using an Arduino pro mini 5v, an ADXL345 accelerometer by Adafruit, along with an SD card breakout board using the SPI communication.

I have searched countless forums which leads me down tunnels getting me more confused than when I began so I figure I should post my problems here and get a direct answer to my own situation.

Through example codes, I have constructed my own code to read data from the ADXL345 and write it to the SD card on the SD breakout board. For the most part, I understand most of my code. I am not sure I need the 'interupt' features for my project but I left them in the code for the time being. It has compiled fine but when opening the serial monitor I generally receive all zeroes as output data. Occasionally, it prints out 13.9776000976-0.9983999252-0.9983999252  
\-0.9983999252-0.9983999252-0.9983999252 repeating. I have double checked my wiring and have both the ADXL345 and SD Breakout Board running over SPI together. When I move the accelerometer around, no numbers change on the output screen. I have the pro mini attached via Sparkfun's FTDI basic board to upload code.

arduino,"Gate control code worked for years on previous arduino, but becomes unresponsive in under 24 hours on replacement board.","I have an automated gate whose controller was fried by a lightning strike a few years ago and the company long ago stopped making that part. So I reviewed the schematic and built a replacement using an arduino and a 2 relay board. The replacement worked great until it was also killed by an electrical storm, long metal fences seem to attract lightning.

I reloaded the code onto a new arduino and now it becomes unresponsive after being on for a few hours.

I have run numerous bench test scenarios and cannot replicate the fault mode. Is it possible that I have a bad arduino or is it my code:

arduino,ADXL345: Receiving Zeroes as Output Data over SPI,"Hello everyone!

I am attempting to construct a data-logger using an Arduino pro mini 5v, an ADXL345 accelerometer by Adafruit, along with an SD card breakout board using the SPI communication.

I have searched countless forums which leads me down tunnels getting me more confused than when I began so I figure I should post my problems here and get a direct answer to my own situation.

Through example codes found online, I have constructed a code to read data from the ADXL345 and write it to the SD card on the SD breakout board. For the most part, I understand most of the code. I am not sure I need the 'interupt' features for my project but I left them in the code for the time being. It has compiled fine but when opening the serial monitor I generally receive all zeroes as output data. Occasionally, it prints out 13.9776000976-0.9983999252-0.9983999252  
\-0.9983999252-0.9983999252-0.9983999252 repeating. I have double checked my wiring and have both the ADXL345 and SD Breakout Board running over SPI together. When I move the accelerometer around, no numbers change on the output screen. I have the pro mini attached via Sparkfun's FTDI basic board to upload code.

arduino,Soft Power Latch Help,"I'm trying to implement a soft power latch for a microcontroller and I can't find an exact reference for what I'm trying to do. I'm seeing examples that energize an mcu by toggling a switch, one press on, another off. Then the mcu can output a signal to toggle off. This is very close but I'd like to not toggle. I have a switch that energizes but could be repeatedly pressed without the intention of toggling off. I have an assortment of NPN and PNP transistors and resistors but no real idea what I'm doing. Is this possible?

Summary:
Input switch toggle on. No toggle off.
MCU signal off after inactivity delay.
5v source
Only have transistors, no mosfet.
Powering Arduino Pro Mini; 2 AI, 1 DI, 2 DO, no loads.
If at all possible, could I monitor the input switch signal as an input without inferring or just use a double throw?
I am not an electrical engineer by any means.

Thanks!"

What device would you recommend? A Platine with audio jack or sth like the raspi 3b+ with audio output?

How would you recommend to Programm this shit? I have done a lot with the raspi yet, but I never controlled the audio output with 3.5mm.

arduino,"Automated, Off-Grid Irrigation","Hey Everyone, back with another project to help the hobby farmers among us. I posted my automated chicken coop a couple months back and while I'm still finalizing and tidying it up, I've been working on another project that is likely of interest to this community.

 I've been working for about 6-8 months now on an automatic irrigation system for small hobby gardens. I wanted something with more control over the watering in order to minimize water wastage as well as maximize production from herbs and vegetables.

Over the counter setups are frequently not designed to easily work off-grid. They are usually looking for mains power, or mains water, neither of which is available in many situations. Also, over the counter setups are typically timed, and while they sometimes compensate for rain, they never seem to know how MUCH it rained, leading to potentially dry plants after a light drizzle or over-watered plants a day or two after a downpour.

I'm still finishing documenting this project, but once I do it will be all open source so people can re-create their own. I'm also considering selling some in kit form if the interest is there.

Features:

\- 4 zones independent zones, each with their own moisture sensor and pump (each zone is capable of looking after 2-3 ""large"" plants).

\- Designed to run off of 12-24V DC systems, perfect for off-grid solar. Relays are also capable of mains voltage handling so this can also be used on-grid with a wall-wart power supply and mains rated pumps/solenoids.

\- User adjustable settings for soil moisture trigger levels, pumping time (1-30 min), manual/automatic operation and enabling/disabling the zone.

\- Capacitive soil moisture sensors for accuracy and long life.

\-Indicator LEDS for quick visual checks of operation (4 LEDS to see if each zone is active/disabled and 4 LEDS to see if a zone is currently pumping or not.

arduino,Some help with servo cables please!,"So I’ve just bought [these teeny tiny servos](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/154470065909) off of eBay. The plug on the end is also tiny and is too small for the standard Arduino measurement. It’s also too small for any cable I own.

This is a 65x56mm module (Raspberry Pi A + format) containing 2 relays and 2 digital input channels.

The relays on the module are conventional, Omron G5Q-14. 

Digital input channels due to the use of TI ISO1211 chips have completely unique characteristics:

* Input of DC and AC signals
* The input signal has a maximum input voltage of up to 300V (and not the most commonly found 24V or 48V)
* No heating due to Low-Power Dissipation
* Reverse polarity protection

The module is controlled by I2C, which makes it easy to use our module in projects based on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Adafruit, Teensy, ESP32 and other popular platforms.

But that is not all! The module has a built-in DC-DC converter and a mikroBUS slot. This slot allows you to install our SAMD21, STM32F401 / F411, LPC824 or nRF52832 / nRF52833 / nRF52811 SoMs into it.

You can find documentation and board schematics in our [datasheet](https://424d0d27-b424-4b63-af14-8abde920b385.filesusr.com/ugd/f04de8_bc5a6b9a35444c0290c513e5cb0a1a4e.pdf).

arduino,Controlling DC motor based on result of algorithm in MATLAB,"I'm new to Arduino so I don't know if it is possible interface the Arduino with MATLAB to perform a particular function. 

Like I have coded an algorithm using MATLAB that determines  angel of a plate based on the initial input ( initial input can be like time of the Day)  so in order to tilt the plate to that angle I would like to employ a DC motor and lead screw mechanism and a feed back loop using a Gyro sensor. The Dc motor should run until the gyro achieves this angle and then cut off whenever this angle is achieved.

My doubt is like if it is possible to transfer this algorithm to an Arduino Uno and make it run internally with at a particular interval like every 5 - 10 minutes so that the angle calculated can be directly used for DC motor driving instead of giving it to Arduino manually.

I have a project in which I am to control stepper motor rotation precisely at 1 degree or even 0.5 degree increments.

So far I have been able to successfully solve the following:  


\- One of my goals which is the trap playing a random capture sound from the SD card. These sounds contain the standard capture sound, but integrate different ""Ghosts"" for variation.  


\- When the trap started up one of the LEDs on the NeoPixel would light green. I had to add in (  `strip.fill(strip.Color(0,0,0,0));` in order to shut them all off.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I was able to get the blinking red light at the end of the capture sequence to blink in time with the audio using delays.  


...  


The following are the problems I would like to solve.  


**Issue 1: Slowage**

I am not sure if it is the code, the hardware of both, but there are times in the sequence when the entire system seems to slow. It is really noticeable at the end of the capture sequence when the red LED will blink in time, but then will slow down and blink slowly before going back to normal.   


...  


The following are the goals I would like to achieve in order of importance.

**Goal 1: Blinking / Fading Red LED**  


While I have been able to get the Red LED to blink at the end in time with the audio, but the original doesn't blink on and off, but fades in and out ( see references below ). I would like to get it to fade like the movie. I attempted to use ""FADE"" but it didn't work.   


**Goal 2: Greater LED control**  


Currently the code just seems to strobe the Neopixels progressively more intense before it closes the trap. It would be cool if I could have a nicer pattern/colors that simulate the capture in the movie a bit more (more pinks, blues, etc.)  


**Goal 3: LED blink on pedal**  


The original plans did not allow for the red LED to blink on the pedal. Because the hose that connects the trap and the pedal contains 2 wires for the micro switch, there is no way to run any additional wires to control the LED. This is why I purchased an Itsy Bitsy hoping it would allow me to use the switch to control the LED to make it appear like they are functioning as one.  


**Goal 4: Startup Sequence**  


Currently the trap plays a startup sound while blinking the LED bargraph red. This is cool, but it would be cooler if it did more of a ""systems test"" with the LEDs. So for example, it would play a startup sound while turning on the front and rear LED for a moment to simulate powering up.  


**Goal 5: Smoke Machine Integration**  


As you can see by the code, the smoke machine (air pump) kicks in during the capture sequence for seven seconds. I am wondering if there would be a way to get more control so it would integrate more. What I mean is, the pump in loud and when it blasts for the entire capture sequence it is quite distracting. I am wondering if there is a way to have more control so I can have it kick in to match the capture sound so I can ""hide"" the sound a bit. I wonder if it has to go the entire seven seconds or if a few puffs will work the same?  


**Goal 6: Volume and Additional Functions**  


The rotary switch on the left side of the trap currently has no functionality. Currently the only way to adjust the volume on the trap is to adjust it manually in the code. This is impractical when wanting to show people.   
What would be cool is if this rotary dial/switch could be used to adjust the overall volume of the trap in case I want to show it in different environments (with a beep feedback for volume). Additionally, there is a press function on the knob (like the other side) it would be cool if this could turn off the smoke machine temporarily. That way it could be shown, but not have to always use the smoke feature.

arduino,One-Touch Power Windows for my car,"Hello! 

I have a car with power windows that I want to add the one-touch feature to with an Arduino Nano. Push the Down button, the window starts to go down. Push either Up or Down, the window stops. The window has been physically stopped and the current goes higher for some time (0.5 seconds), the motor is disengaged.

My experience with Arduino has faded since I haven't done anything with it in a few years, so I'm seeking some advice. I have found some examples of others using an Arduino to add this One-Touch feature to their car, but they used multiple libraries and used only one Arduino to operate multiple windows. Maybe I should go that way, and maybe I will eventually, but I really feel like I need to take this one step at a time. I want to keep the code simple.

I'm planning on having one Nano per window, each powered by an LM7805, driving a 2-channel relay board, catching the switch signals using voltage dividers, and monitoring current with one ACS712 current sensor module.

I keep waffling about how to program it. I think I should have the up and down buttons be interrupts. Press the down button, it sets a flag high. Depending on what's going on, it starts the motor going down or stops it regardless of direction. I can't wrap my head around how to have software debounce an interrupt. So that's one of my problems now, too.

The current sensor module will be inline with only one side of the motor, so the current reading will go from its midline up (or down) to an operating current when moving the window, then up (or down) to a greater extreme when the window movement is obstructed. When it goes above (or below) a threshold for over-current ( or under-current, you get the idea), the Nano will make a note of it using millis(), and stop the operation (set the output pin LOW) after a determined period of time.

My brain is breaking. Like I said, I want to keep the code simple. That’s largely because I feel simple after being out of practice for so long.

Any thoughts? Anything you can point me to that will reboot my stupid brain?"

arduino,Is there a way to connect two buttons to an Arduino WIRELESSLY?,"As the title says, I'm looking for a way to connect two buttons to an Arduino wirelessly. I have two buttons in the front of my bike that need to communicate with an Arduino in the back (about 1.5m away from one another). Obviously, I'd be sitting in between them, so there is obstruction.

I was wondering if there was a way to make them communicate without adding another board to the buttons and, most importantly, without wires. I already checked out LoRa boards, but they need a board to send and receive the messages, and IR LEDs, but I don't have any power where the buttons are located.

I just need the Arduino to read the button being pressed, therefore the connection being completed.

I don't think this is achievable, but maybe the wise ones have a better idea."

I tried a 650nm red laser and photoresistor with a long tube light shield, unfortunately the ambient light changes so much it either wont trigger or will false trigger eventually it stops triggering

I use 20ms loop and a previous value % change, if 1 % change on the resistor count it as a trigger,  still got false or no triggers due to partly cloudy conditions or possibly slowness on the resistor value changing

using set values, if resistance &lt; x works, but the ambient light is always changing so it would quite working half way through a run group.

Tried a 650nm filter over the photoresistor, no real change

any suggestions ?  

I'm shooting the laser across the track, probably 100 feet, laser has a lens and throws a beam thats about 1.5"" wide at the rx side and is able to light up the entire photoresistor

I'm going to print up a longer shield to mount the resistor in, that might help block more ambient light, but I fear it wont solve the problem"

arduino,Cassette sequencer device,"Inspired partly by the Mellotron (an instrument that works by triggering magnetic tape with different sounds on) here's a prototype device which controls a cassette recorder in a rhythmic fashion. The motor is controlled via a driver so the speed can be selected at each step, and the potentiometer on the far left controls the overall tempo which is shown on a seven segment display. Of course what sound you get out of it depends on what's on the cassette- using speech creates some interesting effects. Using a tape with a continuous note or chord would allow playing melodies, but I haven't tried that yet.

If you put an ""admin"" card to the reader, it waits for another card - you read the next card and if it isn't registered, it gets registered and can open the door now. If it was registered, its ""opening rights"" are taken away and the card can no longer open door. After this, the reader waits for another card. 
We would stimulate the card reader using a keyboard with numpad and we'd be using PINs instead of cards (for example four digit pins). The solution would work as a state automat.

arduino,Digital potentiometer help,"Hey guys,

I'm using an [Adafruit DS3502 digital potentiometer](https://learn.adafruit.com/ds3502-i2c-potentiometer) which can provide 128 resistance values between 0-10K ohms.

My end goal is to have an Arduino read the resistances provided by my cars steering wheel controls (a resistance ladder ranging from about 800-8k ohms) and then depending on whether those buttons were clicked, held, or double clicked set the digital pot to a certain resistance.

This resistance (or voltage drop) is detected by the car stereo and can be programmed internally for different controls. For example if it detects 800 ohms I can make the volume go up, or if it detects 1.5k I can make it launch navigation etc.

Using an analog potentiometer I have this working flawlessly. I have a push button on the head unit side of the pot, I set my resistance, push the button and the head unit detects the correct event.

Through some maths and trial and error it looks like.my head unit can detect different events seperated by a voltage drop of 0.1v and uses a 3.3v supply for this.

My understanding is internally it would be using a voltage divider to compare this against and from measurements it looks like it must have a 2k internal resistor to do this.

My problem when using this digital potentiometer is it seems to have way, way less resolution than the analog pot. 

When using the analog pot (1-5k ohm) I can get plenty of different combinations working. Measured voltages are between 0.2v and 1.9v, so about 17 combinations.

When using the digital pot wired the exact same way (3.3v supply connected to wiper, ground connected to RL) and varying the digital pot steps between 0-127, I'm only measuring voltages between 1.9-2.3v. So I'm only able to set 4 different combinations.

When not connected to the head unit and testing with 3.3v on RH, ground on RL and my multimeter between ground and RW I can get any voltage between 0-3.3. so I know the digital wiper is moving.

I know it's difficult to measure resistance with components hooked up, and that doing so can give incorrect measurements but the schematic looks like on the analog side of the digital pot it's just a series of 128 internal switches and resistors. So measuring RL to RH I'm seeing 10K ohms which is correct. However measuring between RL and RW while stepping through the digital pots range I'm showing values between 4-14k ohms.

This kind of makes sense with what I'm seeing when connected to the head unit. The resistances provided by the digital pot are high and therefore the voltage divider in the head unit isn't getting the resolution it needs to see 0.1v differences when compared against the 2k internal resistor. But I'm not the best at maths.

This is because in a voyage divided with R1 at 2k and R2 varied between 4k-14K in 128 steps (78.125 ohms per step) you need more and more steps for each 0.1v increase. Is this right?

I'm not entirely sure what's going on that could be causing this, I've looked through the docs and schematics and the best I can come up with is that my digital pot is faulty, and providing resistances between 4-14k instead of 0-10k.

This would be fine if using the wiper to adjust for voltages between RL and RH. But in my application I need the resistance between ground and the wiper to be less than 10k so I can get enough resolution.

Does this make sense to anyone with experience with digital potentiometers? Or can anyone with a better grasp of electronics in general give me some tips or ways to measure the exact resistance values provided by my pot?"

arduino,What technologies would I need to begin my project?,"Hey gang,

I've had a little project lined up in my head for about a year now. I purchased an ESP32 (TTGO - It has that nice little screen preattached) with the idea of displaying the current period/lesson in a school environment.

I've been putting it off because I can't seem to find the correct lingo to search for the type of technology I'd need. 

My initial idea was to just create a table/array in the programming that basically displays the current period/lesson based on the current time. But recently, especially since COVID, we've changed times of the day around a lot. This would be a pain to have to reprogramme one or one hundred of these if this was to happen again. 

So I know I need an API type of solution but I'm not sure how to best go about it...

Would you recommend it pull down a JSON file with the dates on the first load from a HTTP/API service? Am I on the right track here?

Perhaps there's a push/pull type of solution whereby the ESP32 just refreshes the display if the webserver changes value. Is that possible? If so, are there libraries for this type of thing? That'd save having to download a JSON and will dynamically refresh when the server changes value.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the baffle, I really want to make this idea come to life, I've been sitting on it for way too long and I feel advice from you guys will give me that bit of encouragement I really need.

arduino,A question about controlling servo motors with the board?,"So I am building a little robot, currently im working on the base of the arm, with a servo that goes from 0-180 degrees. 

I started looking into it, and read its really not good to control your servo directly from the board, it can draw to much power or something, I didnt really understand why though. Apparently the board cant handle it or something. 

So of course the easy fix to this is to take a battery, hook it into the common ground, and plug the power pins of the servos to this battery. 

The control pin and ground pin on the servo can go to their normal places though, just dont power the servo from the board. 

Now I can handle that, and I got a 9 volt battery with a little stand thing and 2 wires so itd be easy to implement this, but my question was actually... why? lol. 

Like why exactly cant the arduino board handle it? not enough voltage or something? I think I read the servos would draw too much current, but wouldnt the current be low based on the voltage? I just dont understand how the arduino itself can produce to much power where it also damages itself? 

I noticed a post on here about someone's fuse getting too hot on their board, and the fuse is basically just a circuit breaker that detects too much current, and thats when I started going.... wait a minute maybe I shouldnt power these servos straight from the 5v pin on the board, looked into it, saw it was a bad idea, but didnt understand the technicalities of why its a bad idea.

Arduino libraries approach instantiation differently from other languages/platform's I've used. Some create a singleton when you #include them, and some you have to create a new instance... 

For the FadeLED library I did that too - so the user gets a ""fade"" class instance when they include ""FadeLED.h""...

So I'm not sure if it's best to instantiate the class as I'm doing and then call a function passing ""leds"" in to make the FadeLED array, or if I should hold off instantiating the FadeLED class, and pass ""leds""  as a parameter to the FadeLED constructor in the ""void setup()"" Arduino sketch function?

arduino,What do you think is the problem?,"Hey

[https://youtu.be/Uz\_i\_sjVhIM?t=358](https://youtu.be/Uz_i_sjVhIM?t=358)

I found a video. A video about ROS. I am developing an autonomous mobile robot project as a hobby. I learned a lot about ROS.

ı have jetson nano, two arduino nano and rplidar. And ı have 12V DC motor and rotary encoder. 

 I have completed all the packages and installations on the github address in the video description. 

   
The only difference from the hardware in the video is that my motors are not including the encoder, 2 rotary encoders are attached externally. 

   
So what's my problem?   
\- As the URDF file, I use the URDF file from github, so everything on github is the same.  all connections are successful.    
  i2c connection successful.  odometry data successful.  Jetson nano and arduino nano connections are successful.  
  The problem is, when I want to use teleop, my wheels start and never stop.  I have to reset my wheels to stop them.  This is very frustrating. When I want to drive the robot with teleoperation, my wheels start to spin and spin constantly. 

Video recorder uses teleop keys.  When I press any of the teleop buttons, the wheels spin like crazy. :D 

 I checked all pin connections and cables, nothing is missing.

The only difference from the video is the 2 12V DC motors and Rotary encoder I have.  I have all external hardware.

arduino,Issue with I2C devices on Nano,"Hi everyone,

I have an issue with an Arduino Nano, MPU 6050 IMU and a BMP 280 pressure sensor (both I2C devices on breakout boards)

TLDR: How can I check for shorts between clock and data lines on both I2C devices? Are pins A4 and A5 electrically isolated under power? Although I’ve checked continuity without power to the Nano and there are no shorts, when I power the Nano, there’s continuity between A4 and A5 pins (both reading about 1.6v) which leads me to believe that is the reason for the Nano not recognizing the devices. 

I have the BMP 280 connected to the 3.3v pin of the Nano, SDA and SCL connected to the SDA and SCL pins of the MPU 6050 respectively and from there SDA to A4 and SCL to A5 (I think that’s ok? It’s worked before…). All 3 devices share GND. MPU 6050 is connected to the 5v pin of the Nano. There are no shorts when I test for continuity without power to the Nano. However, when I power the Nano (via USB) and run the i2c\_scanner sketch, the sketch gets stuck on “scanning” the devices; there’s no error messages. When I check voltage between GND and each A4 and A5, the voltage is 1.6v. There’s also continuity between A5 and A4 when the Nano is powered (which really threw me off). Does this sound like a shorted A4 and A5? 

Sorry for the silly questions, this is the first time I’ve had an issue like this but I appreciate and thank you for your help in advance!"

arduino,What is going on with my 8x8x8 cube?," The area of Vietnam I live in is currently in full lockdown. As a result, I have a lot of free time. I wanted to work on an electronics project. I have plenty of copper wire, LEDs, resistors, and 74HC595 ICs, so I decided to try and make a LED cube by reverse engineering (there wasn't a schematic) this instructable:

[https://www.instructables.com/8x8x8-Led-Cube-2/](https://www.instructables.com/8x8x8-Led-Cube-2/)

As per the images, I daisy chained the nine (9) 75HC595 ICs while using the last (9th) IC for the anode terminals of the cube. Programming a 3D boolean array is above my programming ability, so I ripped the code off of the same instructable as well. Unfortunately, it is commented in Spanish. The code is here:

[https://github.com/Ledolas/LedCube](https://github.com/Ledolas/LedCube)

In the end, I had to modify the design because the transistors were spontaneously activating from residual voltage, even when there was not any clock/data signals being sent to the 74HC595 ICs. To fix this, I installed some pull down resistors to ground the base pin for the transistors. This seemed to fix the problem, however there is another problem now. The LEDs seem to turn on randomly and so quickly that they are almost fully on. See a video of this behaviour (with only the 1st and 9th IC connected wires up to the LEDs) here:

[https://imgur.com/a/1MoQ0dD](https://imgur.com/a/1MoQ0dD)

This will be the second time I have rebuilt this project. Originally, I thought the thin insulation on 30AWG wires might be leading to some cross talk between the data/clock pins. However, this rebuild (using 24AWG wire with thick insulation) still has the same behavior. I am clueless what the problem could be. Any ideas?"

arduino,How to get less drop-outs from HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor,"Hi all, 

I am currently working on a project that uses an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to detect the distance of a hand within a 5-40cm proximity (controls parameters within a software). 

I have noticed that the  HC-SR04 isn't the most accurate sensor when it comes to detectign small objects (e.g. hands). I read somewhere that it has a minimum detection area of 70x70cm which is pretty large, which explains why I am experiencing stray values sometimes (reading values of e.g. 5m away, even though my hand is e.g. 16cm away). 

My current idea for a workaround is to use a ""smooth"" function that checks 10 values and averages between them, however this doesnt seem like a perfect solution. 

Does anyone have a better idea of how to get a more accurate reading to detect hands with the HC-SR04? Or an alternative sensor I could use that is more accurate? I read that the ""Parallax Ping"" is a lot more accurate and is designed to detect smaller objects (e.g. hands), however, it costs +$30. Does anyone know of a cheaper alternative? 

Thanks,

ExampleIn this example, we use the Ameba RTL8722 module connects to a Waveshare 2.9inch e-Paper module to display a few QR codes. The display uses the flexible substrate as a base plate, with an interface and a reference system design. The 2.9” active area contains 296×128 pixels and has 1-bit white/black full display capabilities. An integrated circuit contains gate buffer, source buffer, interface, timing control logic, oscillator, etc… are supplied with each panel. You may refer to the official [2.9inch e-Paper HAT (D) datasheet](https://www.waveshare.net/w/upload/b/b5/2.9inch_e-Paper_(D)_Specification.pdf) to know more information about this module.

Firstly, you need to prepare a picture/photo in the format of 296×128 pixels. We can easily find a photo resizing tool online, for example, the [Online Image Resizer](https://resizeimage.net/). Following the instructions on the website, then download the generated image in JPG format. Secondly, we use the [Image2LCD](http://www.waveshare.net/w/upload/3/36/Image2Lcd.7z) tool to transfer the downloaded 296×128 image into hexadecimal codes. You can visit this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAmnU5Y96MA&amp;t=363s) link to get detailed instructions. Then we move to the coding part for this example. First, make sure the correct Ameba development board is selected in Arduino IDE: “Tools” -&gt; “Board” -&gt; “RTL8722CSM/RTL8722DM”. Then open the “DisplayQR” example in “File” -&gt; “Examples” -&gt; “AmebaEink” -&gt; “EinkDisplayImage “:

Upon successfully upload the sample code and press the reset button, you need to wait for around 1\~2 seconds for the e-Paper module to fresh its screen. Then the screen will start to display an image for 5 seconds first, then 3 different QR codes will be displayed every 5 seconds (showing in the screenshot below, y may scan the QR codes and find out more information if you wish to). Lastly, a gif in which forms of 3 frames will be displayed for a few seconds.

arduino,First project recommendation for a complete beginner?,"Hi I have never worked with an arduino before and am a completely beginner, I’ve worked a tiny bit with electronics but my knowledge is very little. I was looking up on the project hub and saw some really awesome projects. I saw an arduino drone, a robotic cat and a Nixie tube clock which all looked really cool. I couldn’t really follow by reading the project pages themselves. 

I was wondering if anyone could please recommend some really interesting projects that are approachable for complete beginners and wouldn’t be too expensive. This might be a big ask, but if anyone knew of a fun first project with an in depth guide I would greatly appreciate any suggestions."

arduino,Reading scale files on the arduino,"I have an idea for some ambitious project using Arduino,

I would like to build a polyphony synthesizer the capable of playing micro tuning scales.

There is a [scala file](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html) format archive with over 5000 different scales (which is just a different list of ratios or cents that representing a frequency).

I was wandering if there is a possibility to work with those scala files - if so, what should I start looking at? how to read those files in arduino?  

if I manage to read those files my next step will be to convert them to frequencies lists and playing them? 

Is it possible to read a different files on arduino and store it into array?

Thanks"
arduino,Help with a simple question from a Arduino Amateur.,"What's the slickest way to create a timer while still allowing code to run? Writing a millis() based comparison function? 

Basically I need to check that from the moment a button is pressed on an LCD, 4 hours need to elapse until the next phase of my cycle which lasts for another 4 hours. All the while I need to check sensor values to control relays in charge of heaters and humidity and other things.

Apologies for the really simple question, but my google searched turned up the same thing I was thinking about writing a milis() check function. I'm sort of concerned about cycle time of my loop because my temperature tolerance for my test is ±1 degree, so I'm paranoid about my heater running too long waiting for the loop cycle back to the temperature check."

arduino,I made a game console the size of a business card that uses an ATtiny84A and plays games off of cartridges,
arduino,My i2c lcd screen is having problems with the SerialDisplay example sketch,"Hi! so im having fun with my i2c lcd screen recently, until i tried a example sketch on its library known as ""SerialDisplay"" where you can type text on the serial monitor and send to the display and print it. I was very intrigued about it so i tried it and also made my own. The only problem is that once you send the text you want, two striped boxes always appear on every end of the phrase. For example, i typed ""Rick Astley"" in the serial monitor and send it through the display, then it will still say ""Rick Astley"" but now with two striped boxes after the ""y"" in Rick Astley. Im not sure if this a software or hardware problem, but the display itself never shows the striped boxes when im using lcd.print() .

Here is the code i used :

    // Hello World for i2c lcd
    // include Wire.h library for i2c communication and LiquidCrystal_i2c.h
    #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;
    #include &lt;LiquidCrystal_I2C.h&gt;

    }
    
    void loop() {
      
      //HelloWorld();

    }
    
    void SerialDisp() {
      if (Serial.available()) {
        delay(100);
        lcd.clear();
        
        while (Serial.available()) {
          lcd.write(Serial.read());
        }
      }
    }

arduino,Stepper motor only reaching 1/6 of holding torque - any suggestions?,"Hi, I was having some trouble with stepper motors in an arduino project, hopefully this is the right place to ask for help. In summary, my stepper motors don't seem to have anywhere near the torque they are supposed to, and im wondering what I've missed (or if ive been lied to by the seller).

To learn about stepper motors, I bought a kit with an arduino, a CNC shield, DRV8825 drivers and some 17HD48002-22B stepper motors. These stepper motors have a rated current of 1.7A and allegedly have a holding torque of 59Ncm. I've got a 24V power supply, and I've adjusted the DRV8825 current limiter to 0.8 (current = VREF\*2, the manufacturer says). 

To test the torque, I printed something that attaches to the axle and has an m3 bolt sticking out 1cm from the axle, so that I can attach a load and lift it. In doing so, the motor can only lift \~950g. Any higher and it starts to skip steps. This is confusing, because if I understand correctly 950 grams at 1 cm is 0.95 Kgcm, which is 9.5 Ncm. This is far lower than the stated holding torque. It doesnt get much better when I move the motor to a position and then add the weight either, so it doesnt seem to be a consequence of moving. I have tried reducing the microsteps to full steps, and I get more or less the same results as when im doing 32 microsteps. The kit came with three motors, and this has been the case with 2 of them (haven't checked the third yet).

Can anyone suggest what might be the issue?"

arduino,ADC stops working at small delays (MCP3464)," 

Hi everyone,

I have tried debugging for a couple days with no luck, so this question is a cry for help.

I am trying to configure an external ADC ([MCP3464 datasheet](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/268/20006180C_MCP3461_2_4_Two_Four_Eight_Channel_LowNo-2297874.pdf)). The ADC uses SPI communication and I am getting a response from it when I set the delay to 1000ms. If I lower this below 100ms, the ADC does not update and prints the last value stored in the ADC register.

Here is the relevant part of the code, although I have attached the whole file in case you would like to check command bytes etc.

    void adcSimple(){
    
        unsigned char convStatus;
        uint16_t adcData;    
        // chip Select pin LOW to read/write to ADC
        digitalWrite(adcChipSelectPin,LOW); 
        convStatus = SPI.transfer(readConversionData);
        // extracts remaing bytes and append to adcData 16 bit integer (15bits plus sign)
        adcData = SPI.transfer(0);
        adcData &lt;&lt;= 8;
        adcData |= SPI.transfer(0);
        // chip select pin hgih to stop read/write to ADC
        digitalWrite(adcChipSelectPin, HIGH);
        
        // start next conversion
        writeData(&amp;startConversionFastCmd, 1);
        
        Serial.println(adcData);
    }
    
    
    void setup(){
      Serial.begin(115200);
      while (! Serial); 
      spiInit();
      adcInit();
      // set ADC Multiplexer to channel 0 
      writeData(&amp;muxRegisters[0][0], 2);
      delay(1000);
    }
    
    void loop(){
      adcSimple();
      delay(1000);
    }

The adcSimple() function reads the ADC register address and appends it to the 16 bit adcData variable.

    writeData(&amp;startConversionFastCmd, 1);

The line above then restarts the ADC conversion (not the whole device) which is required to update the ADC register. For some reason this does not update the ADC register when there is insufficient delay in the loop.

    // Check the data ready bit if ((convStatus &amp; 0x04) == 0x04)   {      Serial.println(""ADC not ready!!!"");    } 

I have run a test on convStatus, and this shows the ADC is not ready when the delay is short (around 100ms). I just don't understand why it takes so long (1000ms is equivalent to light years when running on 6MHz clock!)

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Maybe someone has had a similar problem before?  
Thanks,

I have figured out that the plastic bit carries a 10k thermistor, and have gotten the Arduino to measure temperature with it.

arduino,Help with source of periodic reading spikes coming from NRF24L01 module.,"So ive been working on putting together a remote control car project as a first foray into arduino projects, and have a transmitter/receiver NRF24L01 module pair wired to a nano (transmitter) and uno (receiver). The transmitter is also wired to a single joystick module, and almost everything seems to be working correctly. When i observe the readings to the serial plotter from the transmitter side, there is a very smooth representation of any thumbstick manipulation, but when observe things from the reciever end, there is a very periodic (happens every x ms) drop in the readings. This drop is far more noticeable from the vertical position reading, but occurs in the horizontal reading as well. I know that typically a capacitor is used to filter out noise, but this spike is too pronounced and too reliable to be noise. The reciever is powered by USB connection to my laptop currently, could this have anything to do with the receivers power supply?

I have two problems:

+ The Arduino ""forgets"" the current `T` value when no Serial data is input. I'm using simple `if (Serial.available()&gt;0) { fc = Serial.read()};` to get data. Nothing fancy. If it arrives at the `Serial.read()` the value of `T` gets erased. It's not a big issue, just annoying and should be no issue once I get the second problem sorted.

+ How to send data from the Linux terminal via Serial? I have a nice pipeline for getting the integer of the current CPU temp:

arduino,Trouble Recording NES inputs on ATmega328P,"Hello all! I'm a second year Computer Engineering Student and my summer project is creating a modifiable NES controller using only the chip on the Arduino UNO. I was able to get my controller to interface with the console by connecting the two external interrupts to the NES's LATCH and PULSE lines.  

For those who may not be familiar, the NES uses a shift register that holds the inputs from the controller. (I simulated this in the registers of the CPU) 60 times a second, the LATCH lines grabs the current inputs, and outputs the first of 8 bits. Then the PULSE line goes high 8 times, and on each rising-edge the next bit of the output byte is sent to the console until the final pulse signifies the end of the sequence. 

What I'm trying to do is add the ability to record, then play back a run of inputs to the game. I have added a button and indicator LED to enter record/playback mode, and that part is working fine. I keep track of time by using one byte to count the number of latches. After latch 255, it resets back to 0 and adds a ""NO-INPUT"" entry to the recording if there were no input changes for the 0 - 255 cycle. I'm recording inputs by only recording input CHANGES during the LATCH ISR, and the latch count that the change occurred on. This then gives me a time and a mask that I can EX-OR to a starting ""NO-INPUT"". 

The problem I'm having is with the recording, it's very inconsistent. Sometimes every input is recorded, but the lengths of time between changes is very wrong. Sometimes, inputs are missed altogether. If I play back the recording, it executes the same way every time, so I don't think it's a problem with the playback function. 

I've tried using the chip's USART and a terminal on my computer to get some data from the chip that I can use to debug, but the multitude of interrupts seems to be messing with both the data being sent to the terminal, and the data sent to the NES console. 

My two questions are this: What could be causing this issue with (seemingly) recording the data. And what can I do to debug this issue that doesn't require USART? 

I am not able to post my code right now, but I should be able to within the hour."

I like the idea of using the ZERO as its 3.3v, and its lower power would make it nicer to use if I was to make it solely battery powered in the future.

 - If the sim7000 is compatible with the MKR ZERO: can I use the sim7000 shield and the SW-420 vibration sensor at the same time?

So I need your help, I wanna know what i can do with arduinos and what should I do to learn that, what kit do I need, essentially, i just wanted a kit which has all the essentials so i can do many different things, but it should also be cheap.


Thanks!"
arduino,Why is my code not working?,"Circuit set-up: [https://imgur.com/a/AK4tcED](https://imgur.com/a/AK4tcED)

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a project for my class using Arduino but the information provided is minimal so I had to piece everything I learnt from the Internet to come up with my circuit as seen in the link (my code is below the circuit set-up).

&amp;#x200B;

My project basically requires the green light to light up when I ""move"" the switch (I found out this happens if my \*\*digitalRead(switchPin) ==  HIGH\*\* ). When I move the switch again (to \*\*digitalRead(switchPin) == LOW\*\* ), I require the green light to off and the buzzer to start buzzing. As of now, I can do both of them but here comes the main problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the buzzer is on, and the user clicks on the button, the red light needs to light up too. Because of the lack of resources I have been provided, I have been playing a guessing game and found out that the program will only read the code within the  \*\*if ((digitalRead(button)  == HIGH )\*\* statement but does not read the code within the \*\*if (digitalRead(button)  == LOW)\*\* regardless of whether I press the button or not. Hence, I am unable to get the red LED light to light up when the button is pressed, it remains off regardless of whether I am pressing the button or not.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, how can I get the red light to light up when the button is pressed and, turn it off when the button is released?

&amp;#x200B;

Much thanks in advance and really sorry if the circuit or the code doesn't make much sense because as mentioned, I am basing my circuit and code based on what I can find online, putting them into smaller individual projects before putting them all in one circuit as seen in the picture!"

arduino,Help with DS2482 library,"
Hello! I’m trying to use [paeae’s library]( https://github.com/paeaetech/paeae/tree/master/Libraries/ds2482 ) with a DS2482-800 to read the temperature values of three separate DS18B20 sensors each on one of three different 1-wire channels on the chip, but I can’t seem to figure out how to get read more than one channel in a sketch.  
  
I lightly modified a version of the code from [this forum]( https://forum.arduino.cc/t/ds2482-800-reading-ds18b20-temperature-sensor/214138/12 ) to get it to read one channel at a time. However, my attempt at getting it to read three channels has miserably failed. I’ve tried many different ways, but what I think is the simplest version of what should have worked is what I included. It will only readout channel 0. I’m sure I just don’t understand how the library works well enough to overcome this issue.  
  
And yes, I’ve tried cybergibbons library, but kept running into header file and class issues; it’s a whole separate can of worms that never really worked from the beginning. Also, I do have the appropriate DS2482 pins connected for I2C and address.  

Anyway, for the single channel example, just remove the “for (int j = 0; j &lt;= 2; j++) {” loop and change channels to an integer. However, this is the full version I think should have read from the different channels:



    #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;

    DS2482 ds(0);  //channels ds2482-800 is 0 to 7, DS2482-100 is just set 0
    
    byte data[8]; //holding for onewire capture
    byte addr[8]; //1wire wire address and CRC
    long time_temp;
    
    int count = 0;

arduino,Accelerometer based Theodolite,"Just for a little background on what I'm trying to do: I'm a crew chief for a hot air balloon ride company, and student balloon pilot.  We use visual observation of small, helium-filled Pilot Balloons (""Pibals"") to give us indications of wind conditions before flights. 

At large events, we will frequently have a meteorologist with an expensive, tripod-mounted theodolite, which provides precise inclination and bearing to the pibal at a given time. 

Pibals rise at a consistent, known rate.  If we know how long ago a pibal was released, and the inclination above the horizon, we can calculate the wind speed. Very slow wind speed, and it will rise almost straight up.  Very fast, and it will shoot out toward the horizon.   If we take several inclinometer measurements over time, we know the wind speed of the various layers it is passing through.  Similarly, we can figure out wind direction based on the change in bearing over time.

What I want is a fairly cheap, simple theodolite-like device. I want to strap an accelerometer package into a 3D printed pistol grip, slip a pistol scope on top, aim at the pibal, and periodically pull the trigger to take a measurement.

I've worked with arduinos for a handful of small projects, but I've never played with accelerometers or magnetometers, at least not outside of cell phones.  (And there, I haven't been happy with the poor accuracy I've been able to get from a phone's magnetometer)

Is this feasible, or am I barking up the wrong tree? Any recommendations for components? Libraries? General advice? Pitfalls to avoid?

The LED didn’t come with a proper datasheet, but looking at other similar components, it seems like it has a forward voltage of 1.2v and a forward current of around 100ma (I think?). My current understanding is that since the Nano 33 IoT outputs 3.3v from the I/O pins, I need a resistor around 22 ohms. Is that correct? I have tried it with a wire going from pin 16 to the long leg and then a 22 ohm resistor from the short leg to the ground pin. That didn’t work and I’m not sure why. Before that, I tried with a 47 ohm resistor on its own as well as with a 100 ohm added in series. Neither worked but I imagine that I couldn’t have broken anything right?

Our product is hardware and software based - a consumer product focused around a mobile application that works around incoming Bluetooth data transmitted from an arduino. We only need a talented programmer we can work with no more than 10 hours a week to be able to build a solid program we can demo to investors. 

We are a young founding team (both 23 M) but have an impressive leadership team around us. Our current programmer is leaving the country to go get married and has told me he can no longer work with the company. We don’t have any money right now so anyone willing to build a demo for us will be rewarded in equity. We are already incorporated and are apart of one of the nations most impressive accelerators. We already have investors agreed to invest once we can show them a working demo. If you are interested and looking to work on something new with a cool and energetic team, please reach out and I can share with you all about what we are building! 

Food for thought, whoever can assist in the building of this demo, you will effectively be employee number 3, making it very likely if we succeed that you would be rewarded handsomely in subsequent funding rounds.

The project is not that difficult in its essence, and would require about 20-30 hours of time in total.

I have been the proud owner of a MacBook Pro with the new M1 processor for several months now. Almost everything I need (except Discord and Teams... 🙃) already works natively on the Apple silicon. 

But besides the programs I just mentioned, I'm still missing the Arduino IDE. I have some projects I still want to do but without the IDE it will be hard. 

Do any of you know when there will be an ARM version of the IDE for Mac? Is there an easy workaround? I would not like to run emulated software on the Mac.

Thanks in advance.

Greetings and have a nice day

arduino,Custom Arduino board help,"Hey was hopping someone could look over my board, I am pretty new to this stuff and wanted to challenge myself, now I am on my second major revision with the first set of boards are ordered not even turning on. I've changed a fare bit and was hopping to get it looked at before ordering a new set. This board is essentially 2 Arduino leonardo, well 2 atmega32u4s as 1 just wasn't enough.

arduino,"Is there a ""momentum"" sensor?","I want to build a project for my car that opens the moon roof when the car is moving and closes it when stopped. I'd considered hooking into the speedometer, but would rather not mess with the OEM systems in the car.

I could be wrong since I've never worked with them, but as I understand it an accelerometer or gyroscope would only sense speeding up or slowing down, so they would end up closing the roof when I hit driving speed.

I have a USB GPS module already and I thought about using changing coordinates, but I'd imagine the imprecision would lead to false openings, and it won't work in tunnels, parking garages, or some areas with large buildings.

So I'm looking for hopefully a third option, something that can ""read"" forward (preferably only forward), momentum or lack there of.

Also if you know of a way to test any of these without throwing my breadboard around the room, that would be helpful!"

In That setup the battery is charging while also discharging? Is it o.k to do so?

arduino,"Project ""False start"" Triggering multiple nanos using megas digital out","Hello! 

We are building start lights system for our local racetrack. System I built 2 years ago includes Arduino uno, two relays for lights on tower and remote to start counting or cancel the start.

It randomizes 2-6sec time to make counting start harder.

Now we are adding sensors for each lane that triggers when car starts to move. We are using Arduino nano units with tfmini+ lidar inlaid to asphalt. Also changed from uno to mega in main unit.

There are 5 wires going to each nano, 4 of them are same and one is ""return channel"". 

We are using this method because long wiring and loads of radio interferences because of cars ignition systems.

1.+12V (same supply as mega VIN)
2. GND
3. Return line from nano (false start)
4. Reset
5. Ready to go

Units work great independently but problem is triggering reset (and ready to go) from main Arduino Mega to all 8 nanos same time.

When there is 1 unit connected output is 5V, when 2 then it drops to 3,7V, when 3 it's only 2,8V. -- yes, I know that I can use SS relays or transistors to lift that line harder up - but in principle why it doesn't work straight that way. Nanos digital input resistance is so low that I could easily put 20 of them listening this same line(??)

arduino,Need help programming strip LEDS to dim at predetermined intervals,"Hi!

I am hoping someone may be able to help me out a bit / point me in a better direction than I am able to point myself. 

I am attempting to find an arduino code that allows me to change the voltage of 24v strip LEDS at predetermined intervals. This is for a sculpture that currently flashes on/off with a code just for relays:

*Processing video iwqzt7q649g71...*

Here is the panel from the inside of the lamp head that I am trying to locate a code for: 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img o33jbmun49g71...*

It is 24v and draws 1.2 amps. 

I tried to use this guide, but was not really able to get the lights to respond to much after the first line of code. This guide is for RGB lights, so I just designated the R pin to my lights and erased the non applicable parts of the code:

[https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips/arduino-code](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips/arduino-code)

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is a \~5 minute cycle, where the light comes on to full intensity, wavers between \~25% and \~50% at ""random"" predetermined intervals, and then sits at \~10% for about a minute in it's ""off"" cycle. I am using this mosfet: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHQS6ZC/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PHQS6ZC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

but also have this mosfet driver module if that helps: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GLNCRR4/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GLNCRR4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

&amp;#x200B;

The ""moth"" inside the lamp is treated in a different way with relays and I'm happy with that, so the issue here is just the LEDs. If anyone has any advice or could point me in the right direction, I would really appreciate it! I am a welder and find this aspect of the project to often be very frustrating.

I have found a bit of a peculiar problem. I was using some NEMA 17 stepper motors, 1.5A with 0.42NM torque on A4988. These steppers were doing alright, and had a pretty good range of motion for turning a robot arm joint but struggled in some positions.

To fix this, I bought some 2A NEMA 17 stepper motors, 0.59NM torque, and run them on DRV8825 drivers. Even more, I lowered the load on the joint significantly, so overall, I should expect to see the new motors driving the joint really well, right?

My issue is that these bigger and stronger steppers are unable to drive this smaller load? They struggle with the smaller load, and I cannot seem to fathom why.

The power supply is able to supply the right voltage and current, but the only problem I can think of is the motors aren't getting enough current? For the DRV8825, by watching tutorials I have learned that vRef = IMAX/2; and my motors are 2A. I run them at about 90% power for safety, so I set vRef to \~0.88. This should be right, so I have no clue why I have run into this unexpected issue.

So my solar tracker is way more massive and needs a big nema 23 stepper motor, the selected one has a phase current of 4,7 A. Based on my understanding, the maximum current draw would be 4,7A times 2 for two phases? So I need a controller rated for about 10 A? It all will be powered by 12V.

    typedef enum {    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_NONE = 0,   /**&lt; the cipher type is none */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_WEP40,      /**&lt; the cipher type is WEP40 */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_WEP104,     /**&lt; the cipher type is WEP104 */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_TKIP,       /**&lt; the cipher type is TKIP */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_CCMP,       /**&lt; the cipher type is CCMP */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_TKIP_CCMP,  /**&lt; the cipher type is TKIP and CCMP */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_AES_CMAC128,/**&lt; the cipher type is AES-CMAC-128 */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_SMS4,       /**&lt; the cipher type is SMS4 */    WIFI_CIPHER_TYPE_UNKNOWN,    /**&lt; the cipher type is unknown */} wifi_cipher_type_t;

I searched the repo and the only place I see wifi\_cipher\_type\_t used is in the definition above. How can I get the cipher type of a network?"
arduino,How to run a for loops based on change in an array,"I have an array of `bool` that represent the state of buttons.

I also have a `for` loop that run continuously.

I would like to run  the `for` loop only when a button state change has happens.

So if i start with a bool of 

`buttonState[5] = {0,0,0,0,0};`

a `for` loop will run only one time:

`for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++){}`

assuming a button was pressed and now my array is:

`buttonState[5] = {0,1,0,0,0}`

so the `for` loop will run one time and will stop.

than the button at index 1 changed it state again to be 0 `buttonState[5] = {0,0,0,0,0}` so the for loop will run again only 1 time.

&amp;#x200B;

Is something like that even possible?

arduino,Using APC 220 radio communications with Arduino Uno,"I bought this (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-57.html) a while back and have never got them to work once the entire time I've owned them. I've followed the guide on the website (https://wiki.dfrobot.com/APC220_Radio_Data_Module_SKU_TEL0005_) and done some testing as follows-
with a basic program sending and receiving serial data, the arduino easily communicates with the serial monitor in the IDE. So I figured the code is all correct.
I installed the drivers for the module a while ago, but when I use the RF magic program to set them up, it correctly identifies that the device is plugged into the computer (PC) with a USB adapter and identifies the model. It says it can read and write when the module is plugged in. for reference this is the program (https://postimg.cc/qtwCFnSr).
When having the program run on the arduino and trying to communicate with it via the serial monitor, I get no result, nothing being sent either way.
Here's some things I've tried/made sure of- module is correctly wired to arduino, getting power and having TX of arduino go to RX or module and vice versa, making sure the COM port the serial monitor is reading/writing to is PORT 4 where I have the module connected to my computer, making sure the arduino is powered by a wall outlet instead of the computer (so as to not send the UART information to the computer directly). Considering the RF magic program can still read/write to both physical modules I don't think either are broken.

My main guess is having something to do with the RF magic. I understand it is for putting certain settings on the modules. I dont know what any of the net parameters are or anything else I should try before I give up. Thanks."

BTW I did test using 8bit 4KHz  sample rate, even the audio have a lot of noises but I can recognize the recorded voice ..

My goal were after success create the encoder/decoder is transfer that audio via low power rf module (*not NRF24L01*), most of them transmission bitrate variant between 250bps to 25kbps List [here](https://www.futurlec.com/Radio-433MHZ.shtml)  *I didn't test any of these module* so I don't know how accurate they will be transferring audio 

PCM Transmission rate will be between **64kbps**  or **32kbps** , If I use 4-bit ADPCM [external topic](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=115284.0) , I could reach **16kpbs** transmission rate for the audio which is lowest I can get.

Why is this happening?"

arduino,Humidity sensor fire hazard?,"Hey y'all,

I'm planning out a grow project and am slightly concerned about having a 5W supply for a NodeMCU board with a BME280 humidity sensor on it inside of the grow space, which will be ~90-95% relative humidity, with temperatures potentially oscillating between 65-75 degrees...

I'm unsure how to deal with potential condensation on the components, and am concerned that it could be a fire risk. I've been told the components would likely just fail, and that that probably won't even happen, but naturally the risk seems large and I am concerned.

Any input from anyone around here?

Thanks for your time :)"

arduino,Leds not working,"So I am new to arguino and for the past 12 hours I have been trying to set up LED's. I have tried numerous ways to do it and cannot figure out how to incorporate the code to the arguino. I can do the simple blink test on the board and it works fine but when I go to upload a fast LED blink I get a void setup error and this happens with all of the examples from fast LED. I have also received a D1 Mini Wi-Fi connector and it will not connect at all to the Internet but I figured I would delete that and try to write to the arguino. My LED strip lights up the 1st 18 leds as well with one being orange and another being green. I am fed up with this project and it seems that you need a degree from MIT to get this this to work. I have not modified any of the code, just a damn error."
arduino,hi guys i need help for my project,"hi guys, sorry that my code isnt complete, but this is a project that im doing with my friends. its a game we created, its called ""memory lab"". its a 5x5 led with a 5x5 keypad. the program will generate a set 5 random number and light up the led. The 5 random led will turn off after a short delay, the user will have to press the keypad. if all 5 correct, it will code ""win"" . everything is fine expect the part where the program checks the key pressed against the 5 random numbers

arduino,Protecting Arduino AREF pin using a relay.,"I have a nano that connects and gets its power through the USB port. The nano reads analog inputs that are powered by an external PSU at about 4.5v. The PSU is connected to the AREF pin through a relay that is activated by the nano's 5v pin, protected by a diode. The problem was that the PSU was powering the arduino through the AREF pin when USB is disconnected, but the relay prevents that.

Or so I thought... the problem now is that, once the arduino and PSU have both been turned on, the AREF pin sinks enough current that when the USB is disconnected, the arduino remains on and the 5v rail continues to power the relay that connects the AREF pin that turns on the arduino that drives the 5v... in a loop.

What can I do about this?"

I should've put some comments, but in short I want it to check if the value of the potentiometer is between 800 and 1100, at that point it should turn on the green Led, then if i press button one it should turn on the yellow Led and then if I press the button two it should turn on the red Led.

All of this is working as I expected, but it's not behaving as I wanted it to backwards, it should check with the potVal if the condition is met at every step, and it does to some degree, but it won't automatically turn off the yellow and red Leds, is this an expected behaviour?

Please have a look at the video to better understand my frustration.

arduino,Ideas on providing INPUT to another device that has a keyboard matrix?,"Following onto my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/ow8hgf/using_an_arduino_to_interface_with_a_chip/) about my keyboard project, I also have realized I'd like to be able to simulate inputs on the original keyboard's keys via the Arduino. The original keyboard is damaged beyond repair (batteries leaked inside and completely corroded away many traces on the PCB that contains the matrix - the motherboard is OK, so this is now going to become an ""external synth only"" project). 

The actual keyboard piano keys are simply connected via a 2D matrix with 6 rows and 7 columns (37 key keyboard). I was able to find a service manual so I know which key maps to which row/column pair.  Now I want to be able to connect up the Arduino to these pins and simulate key presses on the keyboard. 

I understand how matrix decoding works (it's common in many Arduino starter kits with a 4x4 numeric keypad project). You rapidly strobe each row and read which column(s) go high. The keyboard uses a diode on each key so that interference is not a problem. The only thing would be to have a common ground; at that point I would simply need to calculate which pins should be high per row based on the current desired state.

The one naive way I can imagine to accomplish this is to set interrupts on all of the row pins and handle setting pins high and low in an ISR. The problem is I don't know if I can actually have an interrupt on six separate pins, and even if so, I am not aware of how fast the main controller is strobing the rows. The datasheet for the chip indicates it's a 1MHz part, so this means the maximum strobe rate would be roughly 1MHz. It might not even be consistent based on what the keyboard itself is doing.

I don't own an oscilloscope so I don't have a way to check the actual strobe rate. The problem I see is if the chip is indeed strobing at 1MHz, that means my Arduino would be spending all of its time handling these pin state changes - at 16MHz, assuming best case scenario, I gather I'd have to complete the transitions in around 12 instructions - and that's leaving zero time to do anything else, so that'd be pointless. Even if the chip were strobing more slowly, say 100KHz, that still is a lot of time taken up by ISRs to set pins (although that would give a lot more wiggle room) - the issue is of course I don't have control over how fast the main chip strobes the matrix.

I would be OK with dedicating a second Arduino (or bare ATmega chip) to this function, but I still would need a good way for that chip to do 2 way communication with the other Arduino that I'll be using to drive the synth chip and read MIDI etc. I2C would come to mind, but managing I2C alongside that sort of strobing would be a PITA to say the least.

Is there another approach to simulating the inputs on a 2D matrix? Ideally, one that doesn't literally require 37 components and 37 diodes on a custom PCB? That would be darn near impossible to assemble even on a breadboard, so I'd definitely have to go custom PCB if I was going to do something other than just directly interface with the 13 wires."

The control station would include an on/off switch, connected directly to the battery, a button for turning on/off worklights and a tiny gas pedal meant to simulate a real gas pedal, only this one is not larger than your finger.

Are there speaker modules available for Arduino that produce realistic sounds, like engine noise? Is Arduino even able to process sound well? I have never worked with sound before and don’t know if this requires a lot of processing power. 

Bonus question: if anyone has any brilliant ideas for simulating a miniature gas pedal I’m all ears. My current idea is to 3d print a piston connected to a pot meter, when the gas pedal is pressed it will convert to rotational movement on the pot meter and it will tell the Arduino to rev the engine noise. I will probably add a spring so the gas pedal returns to neutral when you let it go."

arduino,Questions regarding a heavy solar tracking water cooker,"Hello arduino community, I'm in dire need of help...

To begin with, I'm not studying electrical but mechanical engineering and we have to design one of those horizontally solar tracking mirrors to heat up water. The solar tracking part shold of course be solar powered. At nighttime it should turn 180 degrees to expect the sun in the morning again. I have never worked with arduino before or electronics in general, but our cool prof decides it is acceptable to demand of his students to ""quickly learn how to program one/design an electrical circuit via youtube etc""...  the thing does not need to be build, a theoretical approach is enough. 

For test purposes I bought an arduino uno rev3 board and I have a breadboard, some switches, cables and some resistors laying around.

I found a guide that I'm trying to fit to my needs, you can view it here:

[https://eeenthusiast.com/arduino-solar-tracker-stepper-motor-light-resistor-tutorial/](https://eeenthusiast.com/arduino-solar-tracker-stepper-motor-light-resistor-tutorial/)

&amp;#x200B;

So my problems right now are:

First: I do not understand which motor to use. I'm pretty sure it has to be a stepper motor as those are cheapish, have high torque in the low rpms (according to the guide it is okay do have an angular velocity of 5 1/min) and can easily do a 180 degree turn, you basically just have to tell them per code that they have to do the sufficient steps. But: what torque is required, how high the gear ratio? Can I just use a tiny motor and do a herculean gear ratio? The solar mirror is huge and the cooking pot in front of it has to hold 20 litres... according to the model of the mirror my group did in CAD it weighs about 250kg. Solid works automatically calculates the inertia, so required torque could be calculated with the inertia and the angular acceleration. But what acceleration should I use? Could I just guess, saying to be remotely quick it needs to get to speed in half a second, so divide the angular velocity by that said timespan? Following that idea and using a safety of 2 and a gear ratio of 2,5 we had an approximate required torque of 2Nm - is that realistic?

Second: The guide refers to Igor Campos custom stepper library. As I understand a bipolar stepper motor with an h-bridge is being used. Does that work for every motor, regardless of the power, as long as the h-bridge can support the current that the stepper will pull? A datasheet of a 2 Nm 5V stepper motor says it pulls a rated current of about 3A, is there any h-bridge that wouldnt burn up?

Third: This tank of an engine needs to be powered. Following the datasheet of a 2Nm stepper, is it possible to calculate the power draw just by multiplying the rated current with the rated voltage? That would equal a 15W (5V \* 3A) - so could a 20W solar panel be enough to power all this? I'd like to use a motorcycle 12V lead acid battery as a buffer. They are readily available and super cheap used while being quite powerful, being able to store about 4-12 Ah. I guess that should be enough for one 15W 180°degree night time rotation and supporting the about 50 mA powerdraw of the arduino over a timespan of like 2 days (if the next day is rainy). I looked for a matching solar panel and found this:

 https://www.ebay.de/itm/133017697568?hash=item1ef878fd20:g:jmwAAOSwoiZgv04w&amp;var=432311333635 

Could this work?

Fourth: Do I need an overcharge and deep discharge protection for the battery? Is there a guide how this could be implemented for a high power draw system like mine? I thought about a parallel connection for the solar panel and the battery, while having the protection mechanisms in the path of the battery. 

Lastly: The arduino works with 12V if its connected to Vin right? Does an H-bridge also break down 12V for a 5V stepper motor?

I know this is a lot of questions, but I would be incredibly glad if you could answer some of them for me. Im at a point where I would even pay someone of you to teach me this shit. Hope you can help me."

The cart has an RF remote and my thought was I could get an Arduino + an RF module and then learn how to wire a few toggle switches to it and program it so when I turn on the cart it automatically sends all of the RF signals to the speaker and then have some switches that would adjust the volume or whatever.

I was looking at https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino/most-popular and it's just kind of daunting all of the different modules and things and trying to figure out the differences.

arduino,Arduino version of Addio.,"I want to build a Arduino version of Addio. Does someone know of a similar project that I can use as base? I am having problems finding the right search words to get good results.   
Addio is a fuse, relay, and/or pwm box for 12 volt vehicles. Depending on settings you can have an input (button, potentiometer, touchscreen, encoder, even phone through bluetooth) that sets output high, low or pwm duty cycle. I was thinking of using a FET for output control. The current is monitored (I was thinking of using ACS712) and if it goes over certain amount the output is switched off. It can then be switched on again using the previous input. I also want to add input source voltage monitoring so if that goes low the output also goes low, to prevent discharging the batteries fully.   
I have a nearly unused Arduino Mega, with a screen, from an old RepRap project that died when 3D printers dropped in price.   
I am aware that buying Addio for 300 euros for the cheapest version might be more economical than spending many hours designing my own. But where is the fun in that? :)"

I haven't really given it too much thought regarding file storage, but perhaps a microsd card that the chip would randomly pick a file and play. No need for wifi or Bluetooth.

So then he did the thinking. ""I could attach a relay to the soldering station, which could turn on the ventilation."" he thought. But then, while buying the relay he noticed that he also used glue in that room and that ventilation would be great for that too. 
So that guy, who remember, is definitely not me,, thought ""this is a practical problem, which I should try to resolve with an Arduino"". 
And now he, who isn't me would like to know what sensor he'll need to sense the rosin fumes or if the volotile organic compounds sensor he uses for solvant detection would be enough.

TLDR: What sensor can be used to register rosin vapours?"

for the moment, as long as `millis()` is not equal to `trackLength[i]` the code inside the if statment  `if(millis() - timeButtonPressed[i] &gt;= trackLength[i])` cannot get executed. Only when `millis()` is passed over the `trackLength[i]` ; Is it possible to make that `if` statement to work only for the first time without that limitation ? So when I first power the board and the software start to run whenever I press a button the code inside the `if(millis() - timeButtonPressed[i] &gt;= trackLength[i])` will get executed.

arduino,Smart Farming by YS - Project Journal,"*08/06/21*

Hey everybody, I decided to start documenting my journey launching this business for farmers and small gardens, so the device we're building is a sensor buried underground that captures a lot of important data like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, ect

This data is then sent using low radio frequencies to a gateway, the main console is what share the data to the internet and control the whole system including the automatic irrigation scheduling. 

I have no background in electrical engineering, I am a software developer. So I'll be doing a lot of mistakes and asking several dumb questions. 

Anyhow I bought my arduino and few parts to familiarize myself with the ecosystem, I designed a basic sketch of what the outcome might look like:

[https://www.autodraw.com/share/TH5G21T4NGS0](https://www.autodraw.com/share/TH5G21T4NGS0)

**Parts used in this project:**

2x Arduino UNO + Lora Shield or ESP32 Lora (depending on quality of signal)

Sensors (temperature,humidity,moisture,rain,sunlight)

0.96"" OLED Screen

1 channel relay

Wifi/Sim Card Module

Switch / Knob

Buzzer

Real time clock

voltage regulator

12V water pump

2x 5V solar panel

2x AA batteries

Most of the other parts I already have and some are coming next week. 

The next steps I am taking are looking for someone to design the circuit first as I don't want to waste time  experimenting with a breadboard, if you're familiar with this process and interested in the project please send me a dm to discuss further details.

Hopefully by the end of next week I can start the trial period and then order the pcb and 3d printed case for the 1st protoype.

Since IR cameras are expensive as heck, I was wondering if anyone knows of some good ones that aren't crazy expensive and work with Arduino.

arduino,RED LED kingbright L-7113ID-12V (arduino oficial starter kit),"Hello, the oficial website say the red led in the starter kit are   **L-7113ID-12V** leds , also include the link to the datasheet  [L-7113ID-12V(Ver.7) (arduino.cc)](https://www.arduino.cc/documents/datasheets/LEDR-L-7113ID-12V%28Ver1287713938.7%29.pdf) 

So I was looking for the **Voltage drop** and the **Forward current** info for calculating the resistance for my circuit.

The problem is I didn't found the info, only the **Forward current (** **8.5mA** normal, **11.5mA** max  with **VF=12V ).** In the graph (page 3) I can see the **Forward current** is like **2.3mA** for **5Vf.**

**Where is the voltage drop?**

That mean if I use a 5V battery only need 2,3mA ?  so the resistence is:

**R = 5V / 2,3mA = 2173Ω** ? 

In the book say **220 resistence** per led.

Another strange thing is they say the **LED have a 12V resistor build inside** and you don't need a **external resistor** so I tested , I use a 9V battery and used directly with the led, the led DIE. 

**The build-in resistor only works with 12V ?**"
arduino,Power consumption going down despite running additional software?,"I'm running an experiment with an Arduino &amp; a sensor. The gist was trying to see if various testing strategies would affect power consumption. I expected either insignificant changes, or for the power consumption to increase with additional software running. However, the exact opposite is happening. With more software running, the power consumption decreases. I've run enough of the experiment for it to not be a fluke, and the statistical analysis indicates that the changes are statistically significantly different.

If it helps, the Arduino is connected to Raspberry Pi via USB cable, purely for serial communication from the Arduino to the Pi. The Pi does not interact with the Arduino, it only receives information and monitors power consumption with an INA219 chip.

Does anyone have any ideas about what could be happening here? Thanks."

if `millis()` = 10,000 at that moment and the `timeButtonPressed[1]` is equal to 71,000 and also the `trackLength[1]` is equal to 71,000 , how come this `if` statement is returning true?

10,000 - 71,000 = -61,000 and -61,000 is **not** *greater* **or** *equal to* `trackLength[1]` *(71,000)*

I have configured the arduino nano 33 iot to allow for standard bluetooth using [this method](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/can-the-nano-iot-33-run-full-bluetooth-not-ble/626990/7). This essentially means I have connected through UART to the NINA W102 (based on the ESP32 module).

I have created a test code (ignoring the ADC for now) and recorded the Serial speeds through the virtual COM port.

&amp;#x200B;

unsigned long startTime = 0;

void setup() {

pinMode(NINA\_RESETN, OUTPUT);  

pinMode(LED\_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);        

digitalWrite(NINA\_RESETN, HIGH);

Serial.begin(115200);

SerialNina.begin(115200);

delay(20000); // wait for 20 seconds to allow user to setup bluetooth on PC

startTime = millis();

}

void loop() {

  //for 10 seconds, print 16 bit numbers as fast as possible

  while(startTime + 10000 &gt; millis()){

for(uint16\_t i=0; i&lt;30;i++){

SerialNina.println(i);

}

  }

}

I am getting around 2.2kHz currently through the Bluetooth Serial through COM, which is not enough. I have also tried normal Serialprint() and received around 10kHz from the wired COM port, which is more acceptable.

Any ideas why there is such a difference since bluetooth 4.0 should be able to transmit much faster? Do I need to use an encoding method like Packet Serial or add a buffer? Also what is the most efficient way of sending data from multiple channels?

I have also used the WiFi functionality of the nano 33 iot, but receiving around 100Hz using a local server on my PC.

Any advice greatly appreciated, this project is incredibly important to me.  
Thanks in advance,

arduino,Wanted some help about a projet in mind.,"Hello everyone, first post here.

I'm restoring an old mercedes and the radio display doesent work, there aren't any replacement modules online, and a second hand radio costs 200€ plus shipping. The display controller + display module is detachable, so I thought I could use a multimeter in each pin (it has 7) to ""decypher the code"" and then attach and arduino module + screen (+ screen controller of needed).

Is this idea possible? Which arduino model suits me the best? (it has to be one of the smaller ones)

Thanks for reading, have a great day."

i have some Problems to receive output from a neo6m gps module. This is my second GPS project, I already have a working one in my car with an Arduino Uno + neo6M GPS module. So I'm surprised that I can't get this sample code to work.

The wiring is as follows:

gps.satellites.value () always throws back ""0"" and it never comes to ""gps.location.isUpdated ()"" The GPS module seems to have a satellite connection, at least the LED flashes regularly. Which at least means that he must have a satellite.

arduino,Controlling liquid in fast-response way,"Hi everything. I would like to start a new project. A water (or rather Aqueous Gel) based ""life bar"" with LED background lighting. The idea is that only the front part of the tube is visible and a plunger moves the water to the back part of the tube if life is reduced. Vice versa when life is gained. Instead of pure water, I wanted to go with an aqueous gel to reduce the water movement slightly while also making it a little more difficult to leak out.

The LED strips should not be difficult to control with Arduino.

But I'm a bit stuck on finding a good solution on how to move the water. Syringe style plungers were my first idea but I'm not sure if I can get them to seal the tube and still move fast enough.

So I wanted to ask if someone has experience or ideas on the plunger part specifically, but maybe also criticism on the project as a whole.

arduino,"Design a function/waveform generator with controllable frequency, amplitude and waveform for neurostimulation","Hey guys, I'm new to the Arduino world and I'm wondering if it's possible to design an Arduino circuit that allows me to output pulsed current to an electrode (up to 16 electrodes) with controllable frequency, amplitude and waveform pattern. More specifically, I'd like to generate this kind of current :

I've seen some tutorials online but I don't know if it's possible to change the waveform pattern on each phase. I'd like to be able to control every part of the waveform (including for example the amplitude of each wave).

Also, these tutorials seem to have a maximum frequency of about 200 Hz and I'm wondering if there is a way to support higher frequencies (1MHz for example). 

Now, because I'm dealing with electrodes used in neurostimulation, current and voltage-controlled amplitudes are very useful. For example, it's very useful to know the minimum current required to generate a muscle contraction (it's really not easy to convert voltage into current when the resistance varies a lot on the skin). I know it's very tricky to make a current-controlled waveform but arent there chips that can read current and feed it back to the Arduino processor so it can adjust the voltage accordingly? 

Current neurostimulators on the market allow all these kinds of features but their code is locked, so I'm turning to Arduinos to see if it can do the same!"

The sound device I am using and its schematics are in the link below

[https://www.digikey.ca/htmldatasheets/production/1844783/0/0/1/sound-detector-hookup-guide.html](https://www.digikey.ca/htmldatasheets/production/1844783/0/0/1/sound-detector-hookup-guide.html)

The is a light on the device that blinks read whenever the sound you make a sound near the microphone, if there is no sound the light stays off.  When I run the code below everything works fine, the reading (when there is no noise) is between 40-60, and when I start making noise the light shoots on, and the input number increases. (by the way, sensitivity is just a variable I use to modify the input to help select a color)

`int x = analogRead(0);`

`x = x * sensitivity;`

`Serial.println(x);`

arduino,Weird Old Arcade Game - help needed,"Hello, I am making an ""Ice Cold Beer"" arcade game. It works by controlling 2 steppers on either side of the play field moving each end of a connecting rod up and down (with the ability to tilt the rod) used to guide a ball bearing into a flashing hole. The normal version of the game has 10 (maybe 30 non-objective holes) objective holes to get a ball bearing in one at a time with increasing difficultly in dodging non-objective holes. Each objective hole has an LED behind it and a inductive proximity switch to detect if the ball goes into the right hole.

15 LEDs (individually controlled)  
15 Inductive Proximity switches (individually monitored)  
2 1-axis hand controls (up-null-down) controlling rod height for their respective side using steppers  
Simple game logic (sink hole 1, reset board, light up hole 2, ect.)  
Small LCD screen  
maybe a small speaker?

I have most of the components and physical engineering figured out but am having a hard time determining what to use to control it all correctly. I have a P1 4 2gb but I feel like Arduino is a better fit (but have no experience with Arduino)

If you are someone who could do this are willing to help more than just a few comments I am happy to compensate you for your time."
arduino,First time coding for Arduino - SharpIR Motion to Joystick input,"Hello!

This is my first time working with a microcontroller (specifically a Teensy 2.0), I have it currently connected to four Sharp IR motion sensors, and have used the sample code as a reference to get it outputting the distance detected by each sensor to the Serial Monitor in the Arduino Software. I want to get it so that when it detects an object under 20cm away (like a hand swiping over it for example) that it sends gamepad input to the game that's playing. However, after looking over multiple joystick examples I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly how to do it. Someone mentioned that perhaps using MIDI as the input type might be better since I'm looking to use this for a rhythm game (StepMania in Dance Maniax mode), but I'm not entirely sure how to go about that either.

This is the code that I currently have. What's the best way to go about something like this?

From the specs it had 1MB and I wasn't confident it could handle 1280x720+ (specs said something like 800x600). Teensy seems pretty powerful. I was wondering what GPU I can use with it for either hdmi out on a monitor OR a handheld screen. If the suggestion is for a handheld screen I'd like it to be 'phone quality' ie a touch screen that is at least 16bit per pixel (5+bits per color) and no less than 854x480 (iphone 4 was 960x640 so that or higher is ideal)

What are my options? I specifically want no OS. I am very likely to have many physical buttons connected to my device and I'm likely to attach a wifi module so I can download new binaries over the network instead of use usb/SD each time. If someone recommends a handheld solution I'll likely attached a cell module since I used one for work before (it's not too bad after getting use to it and reading the docs!)"

arduino,Auto switch off in battery level,"Hi,

Not really an Arduino post but I don't know where to post and I guess you guys are the most technical minded group I am in.

I have a tracker device in an excavator connected to the excavator 12v car battery.  I would like to find some type of switch that when it detects that battery voltage is sub say 11.5v for say 5 minutes then it will switch off the power to the tracker.  I don't use the excavator too often so the alternator won't be charging the car battery for a long time.  Basically I am hoping that when I don't use the excavator for a few weeks I can be rest assured that when car battery reaches a certain level it will switch off tracker so I don't damage the battery.

Anyone knows if such a device exists and what terminology I should be using when searching?

The idea I want is that when I flip a joystick upwards and release, the screen will clear and a new value will be shown on the screen and stays there. And when I flick it to the right the screen will also clear and another value will show even when the joystick is released back into the central position. I have had limited success using the analogRead() function and reading the X and Y pins but I'm struggling to get what I want (listed above) so if anyone has any ideas I would be most grateful.

I'm designing a remote for Photoshop, Blender etc. I have created the base layout for it here: [https://imgur.com/a/QYQqhsr](https://imgur.com/a/QYQqhsr)

A single square is 15x15mm

The numbers are as follows:

1 - Click-capable rotary encoder (10mm diameter dial)

2 - Button (12mm size)

3 - ""Analog stick"" with click-capable rotary encoder on top (30mm total diameter)

I'd like it to be connected by USB (BT would be better, but small size is important and BT + batteries would take space), each button will be programmable (easy enough I suppose).

So the question is, which Arduino would be the best? Total dimensions of the device are 105 x 45 mm with it being as slim as possible.

How does one clear text so that it doesn't bleed into the next thing that's written in the same location?  For example, I'm writing the Nashville-numbered chords to the screen for a metronome project I'm working on. The values are ""I"", ""IV"", ""V"" and so on for the 12 measures of the blues. Problem is that after I display the ""IV"" and then I display the ""I"" or ""V"", remnants of the ""IV"" bleed through. I tried writing a ""  "" to the display. Nope. I tried displaying on a colored (not black) background with two display calls -- the first writes the string with foreground and background the same (the attempt was to clear the background), then displaying the text with a different foreground color. Nope.

The best but not practical solution would be to fill the display with black before every write. This is not an option because the screen is being drawn between interrupts for the beats-per-minute counter. At 140 bpm, I have about 210 mS to do all my drawing before the next beat clock come in.

There must be a simpler way to do this. Maybe draw rectangles under the text and fill them with black before writing the text? I haven't gotten that far yet. Just a little frustrated."

arduino,Help with this Arduino code for a simple game,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to read. Please don't kill me because of my code, I'm a newbie in programming but mostly in Arduino, there are some concepts that I don't quite get as you'll see.  
This code is for a game that has two stages in it.   
First, you have to guess a number from 1 to 10, with unlimited attempts, through the console. The number to enter is displayed in the lcd and depending on the number it will be correct or not, and the led ring will turn on green or red and a tone will sound.  When you guess it, you advance to the second part. Some music plays and you have to enter your response, same method as before, console, lcd displays, etc. I have added only one song but I plan on putting two more, and that will be the end of the game.  
The thing is, I don't get what would be the best logic to ""advance"" through the stages. The way it is coded right now goes back to the first stage (the numbers one) and I don't understand what's wrong. Also the button for stopping the music is not working yet. I'm doing all this through the Tinkercad simulator.  
Please make all the suggestions you want, I'm all eyes. Thanks a lot.

arduino,Arduino clone with CNC V3 shield not recognised,"So I built myself a CNC using an arduino clone and a cnc shield v3 and sometimes it works and it connects to CNCJs but most of the time windows tells me it doesn't recognise the device. I have the ch340 driver installed. I also tried different cables  and two computers.

What could my problem be?

I'll be using 2 stepper motors so i guess the effort will be halved but how do i choose the right motor? If anyone could help with calculations and directions would be appreciated"

arduino,"Changing lcd screen on press of single button, (with new content each time you press the button)","Hey! Long story short I took some code for a stopwatch and modified it to show two stopwatches counting at different speeds.

Now I would like to have scenarios: 

Scenario 1: One stopwatch counts 50% slower

Scenario 2: one stopwatch counts 25% slower

Ideally 4 scenarios, and ideally with a single button. However since the display buffer is in the void setup I am unsure of how to make a button function with it, and if I can use a single button to do different things on each press? (or essentially count button presses and go down a list of what to do).

Essentially can I use a button to change the lines I've put in bold to new values/words?

I had initially planned on learning more about the Arduino through projects but couldn’t until now that classes are over. I bought the Elegoo Uno kit and would like to know any project ideas I could do in 3 weeks (that’s when I head back to school).

I love hardware but I’m quite mediocre at programming, still open to any ideas."
arduino,Using an Arduino to interface with a chip in-circuit?,"I'm working out the details for a project to add more functionality to an old ""kiddie"" keyboard. I've isolated the synth chip and found it's datasheet (Yamaha YM chip). My idea is to ""inject"" myself into the data bus between the uC on the keyboard and the synth chip so that I can both read the data going into the chip as well as send my own data into it. This will be the first time I've tried to build something to modify an existing device rather than building something from parts from scratch.

Initial plan is to solder wires to the 8 data pins and the latch pin of the synth chip. I'll also connect the Arduino to 5v and GND points on the keyboard's motherboard so they're sharing a ground.

For reading data I figure this is pretty easy. Put the 9 Arduino pins in question into no -pullup input (high impedance) and just read as desired. I can just monitor the latch and read the data pins on each trigger. Unless I am missing something I figure this should be all I need to do to read.

Now for writing to the chip while in circuit. Normally I'm going to want to be in high impedance to ensure I'm not interfering with any communication between the chip and the keyboard's uC. If I want to write a byte, I could use a simple technique: check the latch pin to make sure it is low, then very quickly switch all the pins to output, set the value, pulse the latch and switch back to input. The time I'd be in output would be mere nanoseconds. (Although I might have to hold a little longer for the latch time, so assume maybe 40uS maximum time.)

What I'm not sure of is if this could cause issues, especially deadly ones for the chips. If I happen to switch into write mode and one of the data bits in my write is low, and by horrible chance the keyboard uC decides to write at the exact same nanosecond and sets that same bit high, I'd now have a short circuit, wouldn't I? Even if my write cycle is only 40uS, a short circuit would probably stop all chip activity anyway and maybe even fry the chips? Even more importantly, if the uC holds it's own output lines high or low between writes, the same short circuit could occur even if the keyboard isn't writing to the synth at that moment.

I could desolder the chip and add a socket or some type of connector. At that point would there be some sort of circuit I could build to make this possible safely? Let's assume I am OK with it if we decide my writes have priority and if the keyboard uC tries to write while I'm writing then that write can just be assumed lost. I can't think of any safe way to multiplex this because even if I make sure the bus is clear before I write, the keyboard uC obviously has no flow control so it can just start writing when it wants. 

A much more complex idea would be some sort of buffer. If both my Arduino and the keyboard try writing at the same instant, something would serialize the two writes. Unless an IC exists for doing this with 8 data lines this night get really difficult.

Advice? Thanks!"

arduino,ISR tasks,"I'm building a graphical metronome specifically tailored to showing which chords are to be played in which measure -- mostly to help my brother-in-law stay in sync with a 12-bar blues pattern. He tends to wander.

The platform is a SEEED WIO Terminal, a nifty (?) IoT gizmo with an LCD screen, joystick, SD card, speaker, and a host of other sensors. I liked it because it came in a self-contained case, ready to go.

Ok, to the meat... I'm investigating the use of timer interrupts to generate the beats/minute (bpm) rate. Even at the fastest bpm of 140, this leaves 200+ milliseconds between beats. I'm wondering (without actually testing it) if there's enough time to update the LCD with the chord number (drawn as graphic symbols due to their height -- no font that big), as well as the beat number and the measure number AND a red blinking beat indicator. 

Or... and I know in a perfect world, the ISR should only update the beat and measure counters, and loop() should take care of refreshing the screen, but... I may have enough time between interrupts to do all the graphics. Maybe?

Since there's a 5-way button included as well as 3 user-defined buttons, I will have a menu system of some sort eventually. But that's a whole 'nother issue. I have to get the infrastructure coded and working first.

The question, therefore, is: put everything into the ISR if there's ample time, or keep the ISR minimalistic and make the loop() the screen controller? Any thoughts/comments/cease-and-desists?"

This code does not work for me, and I'd rather use a library too. The SIM800L does output +CMTI: ""SM"",15, but the code does not pick it up. Does anyone have a working example for an ESP32 based board that reads text messages?

The author of this fork claims to have implemented these features, but I could not figure it out.

So, I want to send my data over wifi and I decided on using a [esp8266 01](https://robu.in/product/esp-01-esp8266-serial-wifi-wireless-transceiver-module/?gclid=CjwKCAjwjJmIBhA4EiwAQdCbxutMchd7_N2u0hmec4jTL6S3F7VNJUZzjnRtEo9ILdlJIu9_NTuL5BoCo4sQAvD_BwE) for communication. Basically to get wifi on my arduino. 

So I made the connections as specified [here](http://www.martyncurrey.com/arduino-to-esp8266-serial-commincation/) and this is the circuit diagram. However, I used an Arduino Uno and gave the 3.3V supply from the 3V3 of the arduino. The module does power on,but I'm unable to get it to respond to AT commands.

arduino,Beginner looking for resources to fit learning style.,"Hey!   
So this is going to be weird.. I have a project that I'm beginning to work myself up to and I'm struggling. I have ordered a couple of books but they wont be here for another week and I'm driving myself mad obsessing over what I'm trying to do so I'm hoping maybe someone around here has the same type of learning style as I do and can help.   


First of all, I'm a well medicated mom of 4 little guys with ADHD (hence, the obsessing) and I'm inattentive. When I'm not inattentive, I'm being inturrupted 6 times in 15 seconds so my brain is like, or feels like mush right now.  
 So when you get into long drone-talking video's that begin to give me the ""why"" my brain drifts. If the person has a thick foreign accent I get caught up in the words and my brain is derp. I do much better with set ""if this, than that"" kind of video's- but to be honest, reading on the internet or watching video's is not my strong suit. Books probably are. College was well over 10 years ago and obviously I'm feeling the brain-shrink induced from Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig. However, I did really well with equations and plugging numbers into formula's and all that good shit. To me, its soothing. And I find most code stuff I find has these little boxes that feel like they dont ""go with"" what the paragraph is talking about and my brain just- cant deal. To my brain, a lot of the beginners stuff I've found here is like reading the entire blog about making pizza, when all I really can cope and understand is the recipe? Does that make sense? and in this scenario the only reason I look back into the blog is if I dont know the technique they used to, say brown the meat, and then I'm that person who literally just skim's everything till I find what I need- take that, and back to my note card.   


A second best is some sort of non fluffy equation like guide I could print, scribble on, throw at the wall etc.   


I'm honestly not sure if mom brain has really cut into my ability to retain information but through lots and lots of trial and error I was able to get a motor to spin. The problem I'm having with the animators and guides I'm finding (mainly in this sub, and some google) is that I need my step motor to only turn part of the way to open a flap.   


More specifically:  My \*current\* goal project is to build a 3 cat feeding bowl, that the automatic cat feeder can dump their dry food into and I can put their wet food into (manually of course) that any of my 3 cats can walk up with a little RFID tag on their collar and it only opens their bowl (For example cats B, L, and F on the set up, if B walks up to F's bowl, only the pexiglass covering B's bowl opens)    


I'm only beginning so while I know that I could probably have someone write the code for me, I want to be able to do it myself so I was hoping there was someone out there who works like I do that already knows where to find very, fluffless guides.. To make a motor move you need to start with x, y, and z, and then add 1 to make the motor do a, 2 to do b, etc. Not this ""well first you need to understand step motors and how they function"" because honestly, while yes I should.. I'm honestly lost because everyone starts with ""make a light blink"" and I'm like, I dont want to make the light blink""  


And yeah.. I'm probably impatient but after a full week of searching around, I'm asking for help. But I'm working on a cardboard single prototype so I have time.. theoretically, before cutting wood and screwing boards etc.  


TLDR: I need a guide I could print off about coding motors because my brain needs fluff-less directions about if I want a thingy to do a thing, this is the code for it. My kids have ate my brain and I'm probably just really, really stupid at this point and my kids make the ADHD worse even with meds..

I would also like to have a display stationary and not wired to the moving arduino on the rail to start a stopwatch at the same time as the arduino. This has been proven difficult to achieve and I'm looking for any advice.

An alternative would be to have the display wired to the arduino, but how do I achieve this without the wire getting twisted? (The arduino will travel in an elevated circle around the stationary display). This would also require my arduino code to run two displays at the same time (where the stopwatches need to be different), AND a stepper motor). I've managed to run the motor and display simultaneously but I cant imagine two would work.

Is there any tool to achieve this? bluetooth connector to the arduino and a programmable display? The arduino also runs on a 9v battery to be able to travel without being connected to a computer, so I'm not sure how much power I can manage"

So I have a 16khz external crystal.

I'm using the divide by 64 to divide the clock. Eg: 

TCCR1B |=(1&lt;&lt;CS11)|(1&lt;&lt;CS10)|(1&lt;&lt;WGM12); 

My OCR1A value is 25000 with a divide by 10 for the second.

This makes an OK desk clock. It loses a second a day.

I'm really trying to take full advantage of the hardware and get it as accurate as possible.

What I'd like to do is futz around with the OCR1A value until I get it right. The problem is, even changing that value +- 1 would exceed the entire size of the error.

But if I changed TCCR1B to do a divide by 8 instead of divide by 64, I'd get higher resolution and thus be able to correct the error using whole numbers. 

This is where I get confused. See, the register can only do 16 bits (65535) as a maximum. If I divide by 8, the OCR1A value becomes much much bigger. 

I'm not really a whiz at assembly / bit slinging type stuff. So if I do need a value larger than 16 bits, what is the correct implementation to count large numbers that exceed the size of the register?"

I have a design brief written up in Word I can send to anyone interested.  I did debate looking of Fiverr but I figure there's some very clever people on here.

So anyone keen?"
arduino,Servo turn by itself without button,"So I made this arduino project where :  
1. servo will turn 90 degrees when button was pressed  
2. LED lamp will turn on when light resistance was below 500  


The problem is that, when i start the simulation on Tinkercad, the servo will turn by itself ,but i don't press the button yet. The LED lamp responded like it should. I hope anyone can help me quick because i need to submit this to my teammates for documentation.

arduino,Do any of you cool Arduino-loving peers happen to know the smallest diameter coin-cell/other electronic batteries?,"This has been tricky research for some reason. There seem to be a bunch of varying voltage  which are 6.8mm wide but would like to go smaller, if possible, for a freaky project idea. It \*seems\* there are some which are 5mm(?) For a second I thought 3.5mm was an option but this is the height, not diameter for things like that tiny Panasonic pin battery thing. I assume at some point we run into a sort of chemical/physics barrier and hoping to find some at the outer edge of this limit if possible. :)

Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide!"

arduino,Bitwise operations demystified,"Hello everyone,

So I do a bit of teaching occasionally, and sometimes I would put together a *bad* YouTube video explaining something or exploring an interesting topic/technology, and  I've been wondering lately what would be the best way to approach **Bitwise operations** because they could be a bit confusing. So I came up with this very simple interactive game which's based on guessing a number with a couple of hints and fun interactions.

---

Basically, you are to guess a number between 0 and 20 in 3 tries, and you can get two of three available hints (pair?, prime?, multiple of three?).

I still don't know if I will be able to screw the thermocouple onto the heating surface and I was wondering if I could extract the thermocouple from the package shown in the picture without breaking it and use it separately. I would appreciate if someone has done it to comment on the feasibility of this idea. I have considered the possibility of buying the MAX6675 module and the thermocouple (without casing) separately, but I have thought that if there are kits with both parts, it is because they work correctly together."
arduino,EasyVR 3+ advice please!,"So I have just purchased the EasyVR 3+ Arduino shield. This is a module for speech recognition, which recognises words like Alexa or Siri, rather than voice recognition which identifies a specific person’s voice. However they called it EasyVR anyway. I have no idea why. 

It can interface directly with the computer with a USB to UART cable. This cable is $19. I would rather not spend this on a cable!! It also says it, quote “supports direct connection to the PC with software-driven bridge mode on Arduino boards with only native USB interface for easy access and configuration”. There is no information at all around what this “bridge mode” software is. Does anyone have any ideas?"

arduino,HC-05/06 communication only occurring one way,"So I got these modules and using them for a project where I ideally want bidirectional communication. I currently just have them hooked up to two Arduino Mega's acting as serial pass through to the Arduino Serial Monitor. 

They don't seem to be the same HC-05 or HC-06 that I've seen on the internet in terms of the commands. The two modules look nearly identical and have the same chip, CC2541.

&amp;#x200B;

I put one into Master mode and the other into Slave. I can successfully connect the two using AT+INQ and the AT+CONN\[#\] commands after scanning. The LEDs are solid and sending anything to the serial port on the master shows up on the serial monitor for the slave. The issue comes with entering anything on the Slave serial port. The LED flashes to say the Arduino received something, but I get no indications on either the slave or master serial monitors.

&amp;#x200B;

I have verified that it is not a connection issue as when I disconnect the master, the Slave responds instantly to any AT commands I give it. Are these modules not all set up for bidirectional? Or have I got unlucky and gotten a faulty one? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I have spent many hours trying to debug this now, and slowly running out of time!"

arduino,Battery efficient method of measuring voltage,"Hi!

I am working on a project for a battery-powered ESP32.  The intent is for it to deep sleep for long periods (\~18 hours per day), wake, take a couple of environmental measurements, transmit them over wifi, then go back to sleep again.  One of the measurements I'd like to take is battery voltage, so that I can replace the battery as needed.

The concern I have is that the standard way to measure battery voltage is to use a divider by applying appropriately-sized resistors.  I really want to maximise battery life, and I'm wondering if using the resistors is going to adversely affect this.

Can anyone offer insight as to how much a voltage divider is going to increase battery consumption?

TIA!"

arduino,SIM800l module won't work nor get signal,"I have set up an arduino UNO connected via usb to my pc and also powered with 12v external. I also have atacched to it a SIM800l module powered from an MT3608 step up from the 3.3v pin, reaching 4.25v (I've read that it works well with that voltage). BUT IT DOESN'T WORK

In terms of coding, I have simply connected the serial of the module with the IDE, so I can dierctly send and recieve AT commands to the module. It responds to the typical commands like

AT &gt;&gt; OK

AT+CMGF=1 &gt;&gt; OK

AT+CSQ &gt;&gt; +CSQ: 0,0

But wouldn't let me, for instance, change the CSCS. The sequence goes like this:

AT+CSCS? &gt;&gt; +CSCS:""IRA""

AT+CSCS=""GSM"" &gt;&gt; OK

But then again

AT+CSCS? &gt;&gt; +CSCS:""IRA""

&amp;#x200B;

Then if I try to send a message (if it accepts the ""AT+CMGF=1"" without throwing an error), it fails when i load any number. I've already tried 3 different companies and moves all around town to see if that was the issue; and it keeps failing, allways at random places or steps of the process. It just doesn't want to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, the LED (the majority of times) blinks in intervals of ≈1 sec 23 times, and then stops for ≈4 sec. Another times it blink in intervals of ≈3 sec (as it should) but still it doesn't let me do anything more that read de CCID data or check the signal strenght.

arduino,Design help needed,"I am trying to build a system to control a couple of servos wirelessly over bluetooth and need help with design and testing. I'm happy to pay the right person a fair price (you tell me!). I'll give a brief overview to help. 

I want to send signals from two (commercial) buttons over bluetooth. One button is ""up"" the other is ""down"". There are two sets of buttons, one positioned for each hand of the operator.

The receiver (only 6-8 feet away) will then activate one of two servos (one for ""up"" and the other for ""down"") which will run until it pushes a cog X degrees with a ratchet. The servo doesn't need to sense the distance to move, it can just run until the ratchet mechanism hits a ""stop"" (a button or maybe a light sensor) which then tells the servo to reset to its start position.

The mechanical aspects of this are being handled by me. I need help with the circuit design. The system should be as tiny as possible, I want to use the smallest, cheapest, most power efficient piece possible. If it can be done more simply than Arduino great.

Apologies in advance if this is confusing. I will answer all and any questions necessary."

arduino,I need help with NanoPixels.,"Hello Fellow Redditors.

I don't know if this is the right Place to find help but I really hope, that you all can help me.  
At the moment I am programming a NanoPixel Ring Light. It all works fine and looks pretty nice and all but then I wanted to take it a step up and programm a more detailed animation. For this I started using a Timer that works on Interrupts. Now my problem:  
The timer runs out every second and then controlls some things and sets some Pixel and then, at least, he uses the function ""strip.show();"" . This however makes a problem because the Timer works on Interrupts and therefor even interrupts the Adafruit\_NeoPixel library and this resutls in some really bad flickering. I guess because the library wasn't ready writing on the strip when the refresh was started.

Now I hope that you guys here have an Idea how I can solve this problem.  
Thanks in advance to everyone.

arduino,Using a relay to protect AREF pin.,"I have two relays that I purchased at the store, [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32474464501.html) and one that resembles [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32238388999.html) but for 5v. I understand the second one is a reed relay, but I'm not sure what the first one actually is, though there seems to be a drawing of a coil in the schematic at the shop.

I've been able to switch them on and off using the 5v on the arduino. My intention is to run the 4.5v from my external PSU through the relay to AREF and have it get activated by the 5V from the USB, so that the AREF pin is only taking input voltage when the arduino is plugged in. This plugging/unplugging would be a rare event, maybe once every hour of use.

While looking up tutorials, I found a lot about diodes and transistors. I'm wondering if I need to use all of this or if it's for protection of the arduino. Can I just connect the 5v directly to the coil leads and the 4.5v directly to the relay pins and call it a day? Or is there some quick way to protect the arduino without the need of a transistor?"

arduino,Detecting presence of AC current/voltage for pilot lights,"hi,

There are pilot lights on a metal enclosure panels.

The pilots has LED inside, and turns on when 230V AC goes thru it.

Usually to indicate certain state.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I want to detect this light and send the result thru Wifi or BLE using Arduino.

How do I detect the 230V AC ?

The current is small less than 2mA.

It has to be non-intrusive (can't cut the wire, or connect to the terminals).

Was thinking of CT clamp, but the current is too small."
arduino,Arduino Pro Micro crashes when used with NRF24L01 &amp; RF24,"I've recently made a remote control car using a pro micro and a NRF24l01+ module. I've encountered a problem where the pro micro crashes. So far, my debugging has made the following observations:  


1. It always crashes after it receives a command and processes it.

2. The number of commands it can receive before it crashes isn't fixed.

3. After crashing, the pro micro happily resets and will be functional until it crashes again.

4. The crash happens even when connected to the benchtop power supply &amp; lifted off the desk(to reduce motor current).

This has led me to believe that it's either a problem with the limitations of the pro micro itself or a problem with the coding. This is the first time I've used the pro micro / 32u4 and I had to learn about the NRF24L01+ &amp; RF24 piecemeal from what I could find.

arduino,Arduino crashing,"I'm making a little animation of the characters from Pac-Man.  Using a 32x8 LED display (ws2812b chips), Pac-Man scrolls from left to right, followed by the four ghosts.  After they are off the display, the four ghosts come back in from the right (this time in blue), followed by Pac-Man chasing them.

I'm using a half dozen or so arrays to identify which pixels should be lit (and what colors), and incrementing them to the left or right to simulate the movement.

Each parts is going together great, until I combine them all together.  When I have the ghosts animated, the blue ghosts animated, and pacman animated with his different mouth movements, and attempt to upload it to an Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno, the Arduino crashes (won't send any data to the display).  If I comment out any one of the elements (a ghost sprite or a pacman sprite), the code uploads and the Arduino does its thing without any problems.

The code complies without any errors.

Am I overrunning something in the Arduino causing the crash?  Will making more efficient use of memory space help solve the problem?

I can upload the code if that would help - it is pretty long though.  (Maybe upload a sample showing how the program is structured might help?)

Any suggestions would be appreciated!  Thanks in advance!"

arduino,Toggle 5V and UART Tx for TRS midi,"I'm breaking my head over solving this issue and like a little help.

My aim is to make a TRS midi out where I can switch the midi type in software.

E.g. T = 5V and R = UART Tx and if I pull a pin HIGH then it will be T = UART Tx and R = 5V.

I've been thinking about a mux with 2ch spdt but it seems I'm missing something or there might be an easier or more cost effective solution. (Eg. hex inverter and pnp transistor?) Or is there some schematic for making an alternating circuit? (Like an AB switch)

The easiest way would be to have two uarts and just use one for data and the other as output pin but since most of my arduinos feature 1 uart that's not viable. Also another question: would this conflict if the uart as output has data incoming on the other pin?"

arduino,"ESP32 RTOS loop-reboot, I don't know what's the problem.","In a nutshell, I've got a final project for a dishwasher that I have to make from scratch. Components already came, and I wanted to test it all first beforehand on the ESP32.

Before even jumping into RTOS, I already did without using RTOS just for relay turn on-turn off, and displaying some text on a 16x2 LCD with I2C. No problem at all.

Next step. I wanna read the temperature using a waterproof DS18B20 digital temp sensor, while it's still doing the relay turn on-off thing on separate time, multitasking, I thought, I need to use RTOS. Tried to do the little conversion with two tasks on RTOS, each doing what said before. After the upload done, ESP32 just went haywire of keep loop-rebooting every 1 second. The text actually showed up, but it doesn't read any temperature yet because of it keep rebooting by itself.

I did the research of why such behavior happen, no luck. So far, what I did already:

* Moving the lcd\_init and backlight onto void setup, no luck.
* Changed the task priority, changed to xTaskCreatePinnedToCore, no luck.
* Removed the one task to read the temperature one. Relay task works well after this.

arduino,I need to move a puppet mouth based on the movement of a rotary encoder..or do I?,"So I have been messing around with a few options but the idea is to control a muppet type mouth open and close with the use of a potentiometer / rotary encoder. 

The mouth will be controlled by a stepper motor.

Quick background. 

Managed to get this working with a servo motor using audio input but the servo itself is too loud.

The code I used is specific to servos and I just want to get a manual version running while I look at options.

I had been using a 28BYJ-48 Stepper for testing and found I had constant issues when using a potentiometer (in terms of getting dodgy values), switching to the rotary encoder has solved this.  
This is too slow / doesn't have sufficient torque for the purpose.

With a force guage I got around 1kg of force required to open the mouth to 90 degrees.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/vccZpvf](https://imgur.com/gallery/vccZpvf) puppet in question   
(movement happens around 12 seconds in, needs to open a bit wider though)

I will be using a modified drum kick pedal to turn the encorder and return it to 0.

TLDR, What kind of stepper will give me the torque while remaining quiet? OR are there any other hardware options I am unaware of?

arduino,Arduino Code Help for LED Strip,"Hello, 

I am working on an escape room effect using an LED Strip and need some help with the code. Basically the effect we are trying to get is once a ground signal is sent to an Arduino pin, it will start the LED light effect. The effect we are trying to get is a burst of electricity going down the LED strip. 

What we want is a certain number of LEDS will be in the burst of electricity and that is decided by the int addLED. For example, if int addLED = 20; that means once the code starts, it will start sending 20 white LED lights  down the strip and then once is reached 20 it would stop sending anymore and allow that chunk of LED lights to go down the whole strip. We have this code but all it does is send a single LED light down the strip instead of a burst of LEDS that we decided in the int addLED. Can anyone help me? 

Here is the code: 

\#include &lt;FastLED.h&gt;

\#define LED\_PIN 6

\#define NUM\_LEDS 300

int addLED = 20;

for (int i=0; i&lt;=NUM\_LEDS+addLED; i++) {

   

//white LEDS start

leds\[i\] = CRGB(255, 255, 255);

// If the white LEDS past the number of addLED lights, then the rest of the LEDS will turn black so it looks like a burst of electricity. 

if(i &gt;= addLED) {

//black LED starts

For some reason the unit that I received has three L293D motor drivers, and zero shift registers. 

In the place where the shift register should be there is instead a motor driver that is identical to the other two. Is this likely a mistake made during manufacturing, or am I missing something here?

Greetings!

In the past few months I have been making Voltage Controlled Oscillators for a synth-like instrument.

Said instrument will have three ""strings"" with a VCO supplying each with frequencies. Currently, a 9-Volt Battery is my power source, I have these tunings: F1, A1, and D3.

This is pretty great for having different notes; however, I would like them tuned in fifths. I'm having a really hard time finding a way to precisely control the hertz. For example, I would like to take that F1(174Hz) to an E1(164Hz) or E2(329Hz). And the A1(220Hz) to an A2(440Hz). Please note that I've already experimented with several capacitator and resistor combinations. I need to alter the first VCO by around 10-14Hz which I find the precision very hard to figure out; the second also needs to be raised.

Any help regarding a formula on how to calculate how many hertz will come through both the capacitor and resistor from a power source would be helpful. Or, if you have a solution in changing or ordering any parts! Thanks very much.

Here's the list of parts I'm using to get my tunings:

VCO 2: Capacitor- 1uF Resistor- 2.47k Tuning-A1 (220Hz) \*needs to be doubled

Rn, from the void loop(void), I am calling a method called batteryScaleFactor()  and this calls another method that ask for a string from the serial monitor. It does not/shouldnt return the string until it is entered. From here, this method calculate the scale factor from another method that finds the moving Average.

Not too bad right? well i am having some issues. First, The program runs through the loop before I enter anything in and it will keep doing that instead of waiting for a input. Ex below

My end goal is to be able to ask for a few inputs and make a linear approximation but the way it looks like, I dont know how to only send the certain numbers(scaleFactor) to another method/or same without it sending 0.00 or how to make it completly wait for an input without going through the loop 

If i am not clear about anything please let me know and ill respond asap! Thank you!

arduino,How to calculate which pull-down resistor to pair up with an LDR,"Hello, I am a beginner working with LDRs for a school project.

I am currently following [this](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/MisterBotBreak/how-to-use-a-photoresistor-46c5eb) tutorial on how to get analog readings from an LDR but the problem is that it's only reporting a high voltage reading (1024 for analog) in the serial monitor. (Setup is attached to the images in the post)

For my specifics, I am using a [Hilitchi 5516](https://www.amazon.com/Hilitchi-Dependent-Photoresistor-Photoconductive-Resistance/dp/B08L6HGNTP/ref=sr_1_1_sspa) photoresistor which has a 200k-5kΩ  resistance range and pairing it up with a 10kΩ  pull-down resistor. I've seen people also use different resistances for the voltage divider part of the circuit so I wondered if the LDR and resistor combination was a possible cause for the issue or if there is something else to look out for."

arduino,Need help in project planning,"Context :

I'm trying to make a [custom controller for Kerbal Space Program](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalControllers/). Basically, it's a box with various switches and LEDs to communicate with / control the game, via a library Arduino-side and a mod game-side.

My background :

This is my first solo project. I did one in school several years ago but much smaller scope and supervised by teachers. I have basics of eletrical engineering and I work as a software dev so coding will probably not be an issue. Now how do I transform that knowledge into a tangible product ?

What i've already done :

*  Bought an Uno Starter kit, ran through the tutorial with basic parts.
* Connected the board to the game, with successful input (switch) and output (LED) as proof of concept.
* Made a list of the features I want for my controller, and a draft of the list of parts I need (about 20 buttons/switches, 20 LEDS, 1 potentiometer or rotary encoder, maybe 1 joystick).

But now what ?  I don't really know what my next step is, as I have to go outside the known territory of breadboard and simple components : buy parts first, with the risk of missing some and delaying ? Continue designing and burning out not having concrete result ? Step aside and learn to work with PCB ? Or start thinking about the outer casing and hardware implementation ?

Right now, I'm not doing anything as I fear of missing something or doing something wrong. So, what should be my next steps to achieve that objective ? How do you plan your projects when they are delivrable products (i.e. more than prototyping on a breadboard) ? What other advices do you have regarding Arduino project management ?"

I've been wanting a good (for certain values of good) NTP server on my network to service all those things that are firewalled away from all the poorly behaved people who want to do stupid things to my HA setup. So, of course, I'm jumping into the part of the pool that's just over my head...

That led me to this: [https://github.com/ElektorLabs/180662-mini-NTP-ESP32](https://github.com/ElektorLabs/180662-mini-NTP-ESP32), which is neat, but I don't want it on the WiFi. Instead of the one they use in the published project, I bought an Olimex ESP32-POE, so that it has a solid connection to my network and I have a one cable deployment to someplace in my house with excellent outside/GPS signal (enough foil backed insulation basically creates a faraday cage... go fig...) There's another project that uses ethernet and a similar Olimex ESP32 board: [https://github.com/DennisSc/PPS-ntp-server](https://github.com/DennisSc/PPS-ntp-server). In that project, there's a very small bit of code that enables the ethernet interface. 

So, questions, which may have obvious answers, because I'm not even sure where to start, and I'm new to C++:

1. Can I just include the ethernet setup as part of the wifi stack(?) (others seem to do this) and have ethernet grab an address via DHCP?
2. Is it possible to not start the wifi radio if ethernet is connected and has an address? That would actually be ideal... 
3. Is there something entirely different I should be looking at for enabling ethernet on that board. My Google-Fu isn't that great, and I'm probably missing keywords that would lead someone more expert to better advice.

If I'm reading the Olimex code correctly, I think that network startup basically goes like this:

    if wifi_credentials == true
      connect_to_wifi
    else
      start_the_hotspot
      collect_credentials_and_config
      restart_device
    end
    
    start_the_ntp_server
    start_the_embedded_web_server

...and the webserver basically talks to whatever network interface is active. 

I think I could do this:

    start_the ethernet_connection
    ethernet_up = is_ethernet_really_live?
    if !ethernet_up
      if wifi_credentials == true
        connect_to_wifi
      else
        start_the_hotspot
        collect_credentials_and_config
        restart_device
      end
    end
    
    start_the_ntp_server
    start_the_embedded_web_server

but I was reading that the ethernet connection is basically loaded (instantiated, maybe?) as a WiFi connection; so I'm not sure if what I'm thinking is legit.

Has anyone here set up an ESP32 (using the Arduino IDE) to connect to a network the way that I describe, and if so, can you point to example code? (that I can shamelessly plagiarize, and then thank you profusely later... :) )

![video](qoo1tp9qybd71 ""Demo Video (windows Volume Mixer starts at 7 Seconds) "")

The old VolumeMixer sadly started to give up since jumper wires are not a permanent solution (who would have thought), and so i finally decided to upgrade to a 4"" display from a 2.8"" one. I also Used a bigger slider and printed a new Box fitting all of this. (soldering everything this time)

The VolumeMixer works together with a Python program that sends the current Windows Volume Mixer processes and their initial volume levels as well as updates on changes. Additionally the Python program listens to the new volume level the arduino sends. The Mixer then displays those Processes and lets you select one. You can switch pages if there are too many processes.

Really glad i changed from displaying a single process at a time to displaying multiple, which in theory should prolong the lifespan of the slider.

Then I tried a slightly more complex test – controlling a shift register so that it would drive a 7-segment display and show digits from 0 to 9 in a loop. It kind of worked, but somehow one (just one!) bit wasn't shifted out – respective segment (LED) just never lit up. I pinned that particular bit in my code and tried to change it from 1 to 0 to see what happens, alas for no effect.

Shift register and display are 100% OK. I tried the same test with my atmega Arduino boards – it worked perfectly.

How on earth is this possible? I don't really rely upon LGT8F328P boards, but I'm curious."

Premise: I know very little about Arduino and electronics, all that I know is thanks to my best friend who is studying electronics and creates a lot of small projects. He also has a thing for solar powered stuff, and many times expressed interest in using it to power his stuff (or at least including it in his projects). I can't ask him this because I am planning to gift him some little solar cells so he can finally have fun with it. And I also I hope this is the right place to ask this.

Being ignorant, I don't really know how to move and have a few questions. First of all, is using solar energy for arduino a possible thing at all or I misunderstood someway? I see that there's a difference between classical solar panels and photovoltaic panels (those on the roofs just to be clear). Does this difference have some importance for Arduino too, or does it exist at all in this context? Which would be a nice starting point regarding the voltage of said panels? Lastly, do they need extra stuff, such as batteries or anything?

**Question:** How do you attach a plate (material of plate yet to be decided, likely stiff cardboard) to the stepper motor? (see image here [https://i.imgur.com/Smw7RJl.png](https://i.imgur.com/Smw7RJl.png)). 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I punch a hole in the middle of my plate and super glue the hole to the motor shaft? 🤷

&amp;#x200B;

The end goal is to have a rotating plate like a microwave (the plate will hold some items). 

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr;** How do you securely attach a plate to a stepper motor without it collapsing from the weight of the plate? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"

arduino,Finishing touches on final project?,"Someone described a particular kind of clock feature that they'd like to have, and I thought it would be fun to surprise them with a clock that had the feature.  Except I couldn't find a clock like that, so I got an Arduino board and an 8x32 dot-matrix display and an RTC board and downloaded some marquee software and hacked it to do my thing instead.

It mostly works the way I want, but I need to do something about adjusting the brightness and add buttons for hour up/down and minute up/down.  That's in progress.

My idea was to put the finished project in a box and cut a hole for the display, but the RTC board and the Arduino have some nice LEDs on them and I used wires in different colors and now I'm thinking that the person I'm making it for would really like the extra geek factor of it being in a clear plastic box so they could see all the insides.

(One oddity was that I had no trouble finding a USB panel-mount extension, but couldn't find a power extension: just some panel-mount sockets and some plugs with wires on them.  I can put those together, but it seemed weird that it didn't already exist.)

Has anybody mounted an Arduino project with display in a completely clear box, and have suggestions about the best way to do that for maximum aesthetics, especially with pictures?

arduino,How often you measure Amps? Can i get by with a clamp meter?,"Hello, I want to start playing a bit with small arduino projects in a couple weeks and still need a meter. Thing is, I like to repair my own stuff, so I might want to mess around with eletronics and common eletrical house appliances as they fail, and also for car diagnostic (12V only). 

Problem is I'm not sure if I should get a multimeter or a clamp meter. Been looking at true RMS ones around 80-150€ (Klein, Amprobe, Brymen) which come with most important features. Clamps and multis seem to offer pretty much the same features and accuracy, except the current ranges they can measure. Multi goes to micro and mili amps, while clamps start on amps and read a couple hundreds (although some read DC micro amps too for flame sensors).  

I was thinking since higher amps are more dangerous, if I need both, i should get a decent clamp meter for proper safety. And maybe i could cheap out on the multimeter or might not even need it? But I'm not sure how often each of those hobby paths need to read currents. Would a clamp meter like a Klein CL800 work well enough for arduino projects?"
arduino,Help Needed With Arduino &amp; Thermal Receipt Printer,"Hi there!

I recently purchased a thermal receipt printer ([Toshiba TRST-A15](https://www.toshibatec.com/ovs-support/Brochure/POS/trst-a10_15e_r1.pdf)) and was wanting to get it working with an Arduino to potentially use it in a future project.

I can get the printer to print out a diagnostics page by holding down the feed button as I turn on the printer. It gives me information such as the baud rate of 9600.

arduino,Help with code that should constantly changing,"I'm using an external board called [WAV Trigger](https://github.com/robertsonics/WAV-Trigger-Arduino-Serial-Library) 

I try to write a code that will change the volume of each track that playing based on the number of tracks that playing.

I have those two command that I think should be the ones I need.

1)

**wTrig.trackFade(int t, int gain, int time, bool stopFlag)** \- this command initiates a hardware volume fade on track number **t** if it is currently playing. The track volume will transition smoothly from the current value to the target gain in the specified number of milliseconds. If the stopFlag is non-zero, the track will be stopped at the completion of the fade (for fade-outs.)

2)

**wTrig.isTrackPlaying(int trk)** \- If reporting has been enabled, this function can be used to determine if a particular track is currently playing.

&amp;#x200B;

I am gonna have around 20 buttons that when pushed, they will play a track.

The thing with audio is that if two track playing at maximum volume they will distorted the overall master volume.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I should have a counter that constantly check if track is playing ans also store it into an array.

If the track is playing, count will add 1. if the track is no longer playing counter will reduced 1. I also will need to store which track is playing and change the volume of each specific track that is playing. 

So if only 1 track is currently playing the gain should be max = 0.

if two tracks are currently playing the gain should be -6 for each track that is playing.

if four tracks are playing the gain should be -12 for each track that is playing.

int numOfTracks = 16;

int counter = 0;

int trackState \[numOfTracks\];

&amp;#x200B;

the following code should constant check how many tracks and which track is playing

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numOfTracks; i++){
    if (wTrig.isTrackPlaying(i) == 1)
    {   
        trackState[i] = 1;
        counter++;
    }
    else if ((wTring.isTrackPlaying(i) == 0) &amp;&amp; (trackState[i] == 1))
    {   
        trackState[i] = 0;  
        counter--;
    }
    

the next code should change the gain of each track that is currently playing according to the number of tracks that playing.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numOfTracks; i++){
    if (trackState[i] = 1 &amp;&amp; counter == 1)
    {   
        wTrig.trackFade(i, 0);
    }
    else if (trackState[i] = 1 &amp;&amp; counter == 2)
    {   
       wTrig.trackFade(i, -6);
    }
    else if (trackState[i] = 1 &amp;&amp; counter &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; counter &lt;=5)
    {    
         wTrig.trackFade(i, -12);  
    {
    else if (trackState[i] = 1 &amp;&amp; counter &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; counter &lt;=12)
    {
     wTrig.trackFade(i, -24); 
    }
    else if (trackState[i] = 1 &amp;&amp; counter &gt;= 13 &amp;&amp; counter &lt;=16)
    {
     wTrig.trackFade(i, -48); 
    }

this code should work?

Do I need to combine the two codes into one code?

arduino,Need help with motor drivers/controllers,So I am trying to build a RC card with Arduino uno for the receiver and Arduino nano for the transmitter circuit. I am using a gyroscope for the controller so I can motion controller it. My problem is that my l298n motor controller hasn’t been working with my DC motors and the motors only twitch in the direction that they are supposed to when I reconnect and disconnect the pins that control them. I’m wondering if I can use a drv8833 motor controller instead because I have read on the reviews on Amazon that they work better then l298n with motors. If I use drv8833 instead of l298n will I have to change any code or will it work normally?
arduino,How can I read the value of an NTC 4.8k thermistor that's already being read by another device?,"I have a pool heat pump that has a built in thermistor for temp readings.  Is there a way to read this with an arduino that won't affect the existing controller's readings?

4.8k NTC temp probe.
Voltage reading is 2.29v @ 82F, which the chart shows to be about 4.12kOhm.  I'm assuming (don't know for sure) that the controller is using 5v + a 4.8k resistor to read this.

If that's true, the voltage could range from 0.5v @180F to 4.5v @0F.  The range of my ADC is 0 to 3.3v, so I can't measure it directly.

I would normally add a simple voltage divider, but I'm assuming adding more resistors in parallel would affect the resistance seen by the controller, and thus alter the controller's view of the temp.

Is there a way to read this value from the arduino without affecting the existing controller?  I've seen devices that do analog isolation, but the appear to be uncommon and a bit pricey ($20 and up).  Is there a simpler way to do this that I'm overlooking?  Would it work to use a unity-gain opamp + voltage divider to avoid affecting the existing controller?

(I know it would be much easier to add another thermistor, but would require drilling into &amp; waterproofing on existing pipes.  If I can use the existing probe, I'd rather do that).

Thanks for any advice you guys have!"

Would it be smarter to do two separate batteries, one for each with the display on one, or a single battery for everything? A single battery might drain real fast given that kind of load. Also the Nextion display can have problems if it isn’t getting enough power so is it possible to have something like a transistor cut power to it if the battery gets too low?

(I'm using the Mega2560 from the Elegoo Complete Starter Kit, fyi)

The green LED on the motor driver goes off when I connect the Arduino and download either script.

Checked the voltage on the battery and it seems fine at 9.3V.  
Checked the continuity across all my wires, including the battery adapter, and everything's good there.
When the driver is turned on and the Arduino is connected, I read .65 VDC across the negative and positive rails on the breadboard.  When the driver is turned off, I read about 2.1 V across the neg and pos.

I saw someone commented on youtube that for some boards you have to swap IN1 and IN4 on the driver board. Didn't work for me."

We've been able to identify that the chip on this device is an ATmega328, which is a kind of microprocessor often used in Arduino-type devices. While the device looks like a normal USB thumb-drive, I'm told that this is a very unusual kind of chip to build into a device intended as storage. It could be made to emulate a USB storage device, but could it be for some other purpose? I guessed (without evidence) that it might be an Arduino-style developer board.

The company claims to have ""invented"" this device which they claim can protect the user from all manner of ailments. 

It seems unlikely that anybody who is running this kind of scam would go to the trouble of designing any custom hardware. It's more likely to be an off-the-shelf component that was made by somebody else. You can just about see some branding (upside-down) in one picture: ""Eco-Creator"".

arduino,Git/GitHub has been more trouble than it is worth in my experience. How has it helped you?,"If I were working on my Arduino programs with a team, I would certainly benefit from version control, but since I work alone as a hobbyist, I have found that Git has been more trouble than it is worth. What is you experience? Am I missing something? I'm beginning to think that Git solves a problem that I don't have.

I have been using it for two years now because I thought I ""should"" be using it and because its benefits sounded appealing. However, the tool hasn't delivered on any of its benefits for me. 

1) Version control: I program in small chunks and test frequently so I know very quickly whether I broke something in code. I am almost never tempted to revert to old versions, which are usually worse than my latest version. In the two years that I've been using Git, I've only felt the need to revert to an old version once and it turned out to be harder to revert to an old version and then redo all the good changes than to just fix the one bad change.

2) Centralized storage: Commits are usually out of date. GitHub doesn't help me sync files as well as OneDrive. I switch frequently between my laptop and desktop computers and invariably there are uncommitted changes on one machine that make the GitHub version out of date. ""Almost all operations are local"" is touted as a benefit--mainly for speed reasons--but is a drawback for me.

3) Working in teams: I work alone with no need to collaborate. 

4) Branching: Never needed it.  When I am done with a project. I keep that folder. A new project is a new folder in VSCode. Simple. Effective. I don't need to branch off of my own code.

5) Learn best practices: I will never be a professional developer and even if I were to become one, I could learn the tool then.

6) Collaborate on open source projects: I am not at that level of technical ability.

I spent over 8 hours learning how to use it, setting it up, getting it to work with VSCode and maintaining repositories. I have certainly not gotten anywhere near that time back in benefits. The one benefit I like is cloning repositories that I find online, but that only saves me from downloading a ZIP file. What is your experience?

tldr; Git is essential to help teams collaborate but doesn't help me as a solo hobbyist. Am I missing something?"

arduino,"As someone without coding experience, I would like to start creating programs to run on Arduino: Where do I start? This would be a hobby, not work-related.","Hi all!

First, apologies if this is not the correct place to ask.

To be brief (hopefully), a year ago I found online an Arduino program to automate some actions in the Switch game Pokémon Sword and Shield. It was already done and, following the instructions, I was able to upload the program to my ""Arduino UNO REV3"" and it works perfectly.

This kind of thing intrigue me and I would like to start programming a similar program for another game. I don't have any coding experience, but I can follow instructions, and I'm confident I can understand the logic behind the program.

My question is: What are the best resources to start? While I have the Pokémon program, I'm not able to reverse-engineer it and modify it for my needs but I can use it as a ""reference"".

To be clear, I'm not looking to learn everything in 1 day or having someone explain it to me my step-by-step, but I would like some easy-to-follow resources for a beginner and some communities that can help with any questions it may arise, no matter ""noob"" they may seem.

arduino,sending/receiving via bluetooth,"I've been working on my first project for a couple weeks now and at this point I'm wondering if what I'm thinking is even attainable. I'd like to get a mentor, if anyone is interested, to bounce some ideas off of concerning bluetooth and point me in the right direction.

The project is a master/slave setup. The slave will be outside with a DHT11 (temperature/humidity sensor) and HC-05. From there the master will send a message to the slave every 2 minutes saying it's ready for the data and get the two readings and update it on the OLED screen (.96""). I've read that the data will be sent in a string and ""divided up"" with a "","". So I'm guessing I'll need a function to separate the values as they're sent over to use them on the master. I'm just confused on how the data from the slave will be ""packaged"" and what command to initiate the data transfer after the master says its ready for the data. On the Arduino website I think I may use the [serial.](https://serial.read)string() function on the master to read the data coming in, but as far as the slave goes I'm not sure, maybe serial.available()? 

I believe I have everything wired up correctly and just working on the code. If anyone is interested I would be more than happy to share what I have."

arduino,USB Host Question,"Hi guys! I’ve recently begun researching USB Host on the Arduino Due (which relies on the following library: [github.com/arduino-libraries/USBHost](http://github.com/arduino-libraries/USBHost)) and found the following code ([arduino.cc/en/Reference/KeyPressed](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/KeyPressed)):

*#include &lt;KeyboardController.h&gt;*  


*// Initialize USB Controller*  
*USBHost usb;*  


*// Attach Keyboard controller to USB*  
*KeyboardController keyboard(usb);*  


*void* ***setup****(){*  
  *Serial.begin(9600);*

*}*  


*void keyPressed() {*  
  *Serial.print(""Pressed:  "");*  
  *Serial.print(keyboard.getKey());*  
  *Serial.println();*  
*}*

 

I was confused by the “void keyPressed()” function; since it hasn't been called by the “void loop()” in the sketch, I figured that it must have been called by the “Task()” function. However, upon checking the library’s “USB.cpp”, I noticed that there is no mention to the “KeyPressed()” function inside the “Task()” function ([https://github.com/arduino-libraries/USBHost/blob/master/src/Usb.cpp](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/USBHost/blob/master/src/Usb.cpp), line 713).

Then, how is the “KeyPressed()” function being called?

arduino,Project to Full-Scale Product Learnings,"Hi all, I'm going into my second production run of a project that turned into a fairly well- funded IoT startup and thought I'd share some of my cost and time saving tactics for anyone interested in scaling up their projects!

So in a nutshell, our product is an at-home urinalysis device that measures biomarkers in urine and regularly posts health data to the internet. Can't go into too much detail but it basically uses three sensors (off the shelf) and the gpios of an ESP wroom module to collect data. The functionality was confirmed on breadboard before moving to a PCB.

Electronics: 
It's a battery powered device. Knowing from potential customers (right now NFL teams) that it needed to last 6 months, I used a Nordic Power Profiler II to measure the power usage over a 5 minute period. I popped the numbers into Google sheets and determined a 1A battery would suffice. Due to space constraints, I decided to go with a LiPo as they have the best available energy density. It was a tough decision to choose a voltage converter (switching vs LDO) but ended up going with an HT7833 LDO due to its very low quiescent current (the device is mostly asleep). I also went with a WROVER module over the standard ESP WROOM as it provides an external antenna connector (for improving range) and more flash memory (for the gigantic Bluetooth libraries which we have in our backlog but are not currently using).

Cost savings: I use easyeda, lcsc, and JLCPCB to design and manufacture PCBs. They populate single-sided boards at-cost so I made sure to stick with as many of their basic components as possible and designed the PCB such that all parts are placed on top. This is by far the cheapest way to make circuit boards I've ever discovered. 

Mechanical:
I purchased a Creality Ender 3 V2 3D printer to iterate the plastics. This a highly reliable and affordable machine that has more than paid itself off (about $280). I use Fusion 360 to do all of my design work on a free license. Our first shipped batches of product (that we actually sold for a profit!) were printed in PLA. Once the design was stable (after several rounds of feedback from customers) I moved to injection molded parts.

Cost Savings: By starting with printed parts, we were able to both scale and iterate at our own pace spending just a few dollars monthly on new spools of filament. To get a good price on molding, we got quotes from Protolabs, negotiated, and took our pricing to Xometry who was able to beat it. I highly recommend this process.

Firmware:
Everything was coded using Arduino libraries inside of VSCode using platformio (all free tools). I also got into the habit of using GitHub desktop for version control, branching code to work on new features, testing, and merging when they were stable. This is a fairly easy workflow that will save a lot of headaches if implemented early.

Manufacturing:
All of our parts are shipped to me and assembled by myself and some volunteers. This keeps unit cost as low as possible while we scale up. We've gotten the assembly process well defined and have taken videos and timings of the whole process. This has made it very easy for us to get quotes from contract manufacturers as there is no guesswork in the process. Documentation has been HUGE.

Quality Assurance:
One invaluable practice has been writing unit test and calibration procedure right into the firmware. This way, we flash the devices once and rely on an initial boot and test procedure to qualify that units are to spec and within failure limits. This is much easier than building external fixtures. I highly recommend this process.

All in all, we were able to go from benchtop prototypes to selling products in about 6 months using Arduino code, cheap PCBs, 3D printers, and free software. Bootstrapping this way has made it pretty easy to attract capital to help us scale to our next level of production. 

I hope this post serves to show you Arduino can be used in production and that your projects can be turned into products and put into production without huge upfront costs. People will buy 3D printed devices and nobody cares if you use Adafruit libraries! Please let me know if I can share any details that may help you on your missions to make cool stuff."
arduino,Battery Module Search,"I'm looking for a battery module\circuit that follows this general behavior:

    if batt.volt&gt;Y then out.bool=true
    if batt.volt&lt;X then out.bool=false
    if X&lt;=batt.volt&lt;=Y and out.bool=true then POWERON\CHARGEOFF
    if X&lt;=batt.volt&lt;=Y and out.bool=false then POWEROFF\CHARGEON

It's a little tricky because it depends on a sort of 'state' memory to determine if it should be charging or delivering power when the batt voltages is between X and Y.

This would be for solar powering small devices to allow them run for a while whenever enough charge is built up.

I've seen some 'harvester' circuits that have a pin go high when there's available energy, but I need the devices to go fully unpowered until the battery is ready for a full discharge cycle. So not sure how they'd read the pin when there's enough.

I'm hoping this is just something I don't know the term for, or maybe a part hiding in some other thing I don't know about. If you've seen anything that does this or could be coaxed I'd love to know about it."

arduino,Questions on using DS Upper LCD screen replacement as a second screen monitor with MacOS,"Hi everyone, beginner here. I have been scouring the forums for a while now and I cannot seem to get enough clarity for a project that seems about simple (I might be wrong).

I am interested in making a DS top screen (not touch) as a second monitor to play a film as part of an art installation. 

The interaction I would imagine is that:

1. I would play the mp4 of the film from my Macbook (TouchBar btw)
2. Connect to the DS screen via an Arduino motherboard, with an HDMI cable or VGA
3. Drag the mp4 window to the LCD screen
4. Play the video

I am assuming a few things here, I don't know if monitors, in general, have compatibility issues with operating systems and second monitors being detected by System Preferences. I noticed that this spare part has a ribbon cable and after looking at some screen replacement videos on YouTube as an attempt to reverse engineer it, there is no luck yet. I am open to the Windows option if that is really the last resort.

Any tips or guidance would be very, very helpful!"

arduino,Looking to start an object tracking project. [hardware+software help],"Specifically I want to be able to aim a laser at a monochrome plane and have Arduino be able to track and record were the laser is pointing when it is aimed at the plane. Do I need any specific cameras and if not would a certain degree of fidelity in the camera be recommended?

For the coding I was thinking of having it save snapshots then check for pixels which are outside of an expected range. If no anomalous pixels are detected delete the picture. If they are detected, preform a calculation to adjust for the camera's angle from the board, then record the location. However this seems clunky and I suspect it will take some time to scan photos. Is there a faster way to locate and track the location of the dot of the laser on the plane?"

And I noticed that I know absolutely nothing of interacting with embedded hardware through software.

I have seen some software like ""Betaflight"" an app to interact with racing drones. Which would be somewhat of I want to learn, something multiplatform with a light interface. I think it is developed using react??

I have also read that developing GUIs is evolving more towards HTML5/Javascript (like React and leaving behind frameworks like Qt and Tkinter. How true is this?? I have also seen some people interacting with Arduino through a Library with Unity, the videogame engine.

Tl;dr: I want to learn how to develop an app that can interact with Arduinos through COM ports. The more portable (Windows, Linux, Android...) it is, the best it would be for me.

I just saw the 8BitDo bluetooth adapter and it can use both Nintendo Switch Joy-Con to work as one game controller for PC and even Raspberry Pi! Then It came to my mind that I should try to make a similar device (for learning purpose) with a Arduino Leonardo to act as a USB HID and some bluetooth module such as HC-05 or HC-06 to connect both joy-cons and make the magic happen.

The I started reading some tutorials and forums and people claim those bluetooth modules cannot work with two devices simultaneously. So the main question is the title one: **Are bluetooth modules like HC-05 or HC-06 capable of working with two devices at the same time?** 

As a side question, if those modules cannot do this how does the embedded bluetooth of notebooks and laptops and those USB dongles can connect with several devices at once like a mouse, keyboard and headphones simultaneously?

arduino,"Circuit Playground Express, help with FFT on Arduino","I'm working with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express to create a code that detects a certain frequency and then associates the value with a certain color on the 10 LEDs. The goal is for the board to hear (for example) the note 'A' being played on a viola and then light up red, and then hear 'B' and light up green. I've been able to accomplish this using the sound pressure level (SPL), but having it detect a specific frequency has eluded me. I have been trying to use FFT to interpret the frequency, but I don't have nearly enough coding experience to properly understand how FFTs work. Is using FFT the right way to go about this? Or is there a simpler option? Can I even do this on a Circuit Playground Express? I have the Arduino ZeroFFT and a few other FFT libraries installed, but either the example codes aren't compiling for the Circuit Playground or don't function the way I need them to/ (maybe I just don't understand the output values?).

Unfortunately students will be using chrome books and I am not sure if Arduino Create is compatible with CH340G chips. Can some one shed light on if this is possible? Will I just need to buy the Arduino name brand Nanos?"

arduino,Find out manufacturer from Mac address,"Hey,

I save WLAN networks from the area and would like to know what percentage is made up of which manufacturer. There are pages where you can determine the manufacturer from the Mac address, but im not sure how this system works.

&amp;#x200B;

The first three blocks are the manufacturer. One could assume that the manufacturer number exists only once. However, a manufacturer sometimes seems to have 10 or 20 numbers. I don't understand that. At first I thought you had to do some math. But it seems that every manufacturer really has different numbers. The next step would be to get the numbers, as completely as possible.

There are tables with the manufacturer numbers, such as here e.g. [https://standards.ieee.org/products-services/regauth/index.html](https://standards.ieee.org/products-services/regauth/index.html)

But I have no idea whether this is the right source or where you can get complete lists."

I would also like to add a speedometer as well as convert voltage to miles remaining ( I know it wont be accurate but just a rough estimate would be great). I'm not sure if this is possible or not but just pointing me in the right direction would be great or if anybody has any experience with this that would be awesome as well! Thanks!

arduino,How can I reverse engineer the radio communication links from sensors used in a security system?," Hi everyone!

This is my very first post on reddit, so please forgive me, if I violate any rules.

Seven    years ago my dad purchased a security system, that we never really   use.  It is way to complicated for my parents and maintenance costs are   far  too high.  Now, we have these sensors everywhere but they do not   furfill  any purpose as the central control is switched off. My idea was   to use  these sensors and build a new alarm system out of scratch.

These are the sensors we have: [https://www.riscogroup.com/products/product/50876](https://www.riscogroup.com/products/product/50876)

I    found out that they operate on 868 MHz and 433 MHz but I do not know    how to meassure the signals to find    out what data gets submitted by each sensor. I guess that each device    has a unique identifier to tell them apart. They also have different modes (low battery, open, closed,...)

Has anyone ever done something like that? How do I start?

For me, the wireless interaction with the devices is really challanging, since I have never done anything like it before."

Kept getting COM port errors like COM port busy, error touching port etc. Tried uploading and resetting, tried resetting to bootloader and upload, still got port errors. I googled every error code and went through god knows how many forum and support threads without any success.

Today, after having given up weeks ago, I decided to try again. Same errors. I did another round of googling and found a Reddit post that said that the NZXT CAM was the reason for the COM port errors. I closed NZXT CAM and my sketch uploaded with no issues!

I imagine there must be a percentage of people who use NZXT CAM within the Arduino community so how it took such luck for me to find this solution is just bizarre. Sorry for the long rant, I just felt this huge weight lift when the upload went through successfully."

After that I grabbed a power supply and connected a 330 ohm resistor to it and a wire to ground to test some led lights (like the ones that come in an Arduino kit) It worked they would turn on but not the lights on the cheap lamp. I'm not getting any signs of life from the lights on my multimeter which makes me believe that they're dead. But I'm not sure because I don't think these lights work the same as led lights.

arduino,Deciphering IR remote protocol for older Delta woodworking air filtration system,"This is a little bit a cross-post from something I posted on the r/woodworking sub. I've recently picked up a Delta model 50-870 air filtration system for my woodworking shop, but since it was school surplus it didn't include its remote control unit. I had hoped to find someone who 1) had tried another manufacturer's remote and could confirm it worked, 2) a woodworker who owned one and is electronics savvy enough to rig up an IR receiver and record the IR pulse pattern for me so I can find or fabricate something. No luck over there... so I'll get to the point.  


By way of background, the remote would have been able to power the unit on and off, change blower speeds, and select a preset timer to automatically turn the unit off. All these functions are available with manual buttons which appear to be momentary contact; basically a one-shot pulse or grounding to flip through the various selections. For the un-itiated, the main reason for the remote is that these devices are usually hung from the ceiling so poking buttons from the floor is not practical.  


My son and I were talking about it and one solution we came up with is to build an IR transmitter with  an Arduino that can cycle through the supported IR protocols to try to ""brute force"" finding the correct one. Any better suggestions for determining the output from the original remote without finding a remote to study?   


Another possibility, and probably my preference if I'm going to build something is to build a custom remote receiver that can accept commands from a known remote control that I have in my possession. In that case I'd bypass the manufacturer's remote circuitry but tap into the control/motor driver circuitry. Of several advantages I can think of for that option is that I'd build several so I can install them on another air filtration system and my dust collector(s) and be able to drive them all from one remote. I'd probably even include buttons to cycle each one independently as well one that could power them all up/down with a single press. Another advantage is that Delta put the IR receiver on one end and I've already read complaints from people who don't have a line of sight to that side from common places they'd be standing when they want to control it. I'd probably put the IR receiver on the bottom so it could be hit from anywhere if the machine is hanging, or maybe use two sensors or a light-pipe so I can hit it from the top or the bottom in case I'm using it on a cart.   


Advice and other suggestions is very welcome. I'm probably overlooking some other obvious options."

arduino,CTC on Timer1 not clearing Counter,"Hi,  
Hadn't written for AVR in a while and I'm having a problem that I felt very sure I hadn't had in the past.

I need a relatively reliable/precise counter with an associated interrupt, so I did what I remembered always doing and used Timer1 with CTC, but got a surprise.

When using CTC I remembered the internal counter being cleared on the comparison at the same time the ISR is called, but that doesn't seem the case. I need to manually `TCNT1 = 0;` inside the ISR, which definitely doesn't feel right. If I don't then the timing gives all signs of the counter moving on, overflowing, and then hitting the ISR again.

Commented code below, surprise is the last line of ISR

    void setup() {
        pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    
        noInterrupts();
    
        OCR1A = 15624;
        TCNT1 = 0;
        TCCR1A = 0;
        TCCR1B = 0 | (1 &lt;&lt; CS12)    // prescale at clk/256
                   | (1 &lt;&lt; WGM12);  // clear on compare
    
        TIMSK1 = 0 | (1 &lt;&lt; OCIE1A); // enable interrupt compA
    
        interrupts();               // reactivate interrupts
    }
    
    ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect) {
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, digitalRead(LED_BUILTIN) ^ 1);
        TCNT1 = 0; // I wouldn't expect to need this, I would have expected CTC to reset it
    }

This is running on a Mega2560 Clone, but it might go to other chips so can't use the 2560 extra timers.

Am I missing something? Am I remembering wrong?  
Documentation and random internet stranger examples seems to agree with what I remembered.

Any help appreciated, thank you."

Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is finished.  
Once it is running, you should see one of the LEDs flashing, indicating that it is processing audio. Saying the word “yes” will cause the green LED to light up. Saying the word “no” will cause the red LED to light up. If the word is not recognized, the blue LED will to light up.  
The inference results are also output to the Arduino serial monitor, which appear as follows:

If you are having trouble in getting the words recognized, here are some tips:  
– Ensure that your surroundings are quiet with minimal noise.  
– Experiment with varying the distance of the microphone, starting with it at an arm’s length.  
– Experiment with different tones and volume when saying the words.  
– Depending on how you pronounce the words, the characteristics of the microphone used, getting one keyword recognized may be easier than the other.

Is it possible to get an arduino pin to output 5V, and how? \[Image just for refference\]

arduino,Max acceleration of an Arduino board?,"Hi , I have an Arduino Uno and would like to use it to build a system that experiences alot of acceleration ( I haven't built it yet so I'm not sure exactly how fast it will accelerate but it will be upwards of 20m/s^2) and would like to know how much acceleration an Arduino board can withstand and function at. I have tried finding information on this but haven't found anything and currently I am limited to using the arduino I have."
arduino,What are some simple offline projects?,"I wanted to use my Arduino mainly for MQTT (reading data, sending it to the cloud) but I just found out my Uno Rev 3 is not able to use WIFI or MQTT at all since it has no WIFI module. Buying a single WIFI module for it seems not the be worth (4€) since I can just buy a ESP8266 (9€) which comes with a integrated WIFI module. 

So yeah, I'm new (bought the starter kit, hence Uno Rev 3 model) and want to make use of it. What are some cool offline beginner projects?"

arduino,How to Power Multiple 12V Devices?," 

I am currently working out the electronics side of an automated drinks dispenser. It utilises 3x 12V air pumps which I intended to power using relays. However I am very new to this and am not sure the best way to go about supplying power to 3 separate relays. Is there a convenient way to supply the power to all 3 relays (and the arduino itself if at all possible) without having 4 power sources?

To clarify, all of the 12V outputs need to be individually controllable so couldn't run from a single relay (unless there's a way I'm missing).

Apologies if this is a dumb question."

arduino,"Working with KY-040, using pin as ground","Hello, I'm working on a custom steering wheel button box for my PC sim rig that uses an Arduino pro micro. It has 8 buttons + 3 rotary switches, with the all the buttons including the ones on the encoders wired in a matrix pattern.    
The problem I ran into is that the KY-040 only has one ""ground"" connection which is needed for the button to function but now I can't seem to get a reading from the encoder CLK and DATA leads since (I assume) they need an actual ground connection.    

Is there a way to read pins compared to an another pin instead of a ground? If not would it damage the Arduino if I connect the 2 pin I used for the switch to ground directly?   
Thanks, any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated."

I do have a backup of the older version so I could always replace a newer version with the older version that works for this project, but I'm wondering if I can keep the older version in the folder containing the sketch and include/declare the local version and not a more recent version. Hope this makes sense."

arduino,Best way to power Nano from 20v supply,"Hi all, I'm still pretty new Arduino's (but totally hooked) and just trying to figure out the best way to do something.

My aquarium has lights with a (removable) inline controller-thing that automatically fades the lights on in the morning and fades them off in the evening but I want to do it with an Arduino Nano instead because I want more control over the timing.

The power supply  to the lights (according to the plug) is 20v 300mA. I'd like to run the lights and the Nano off this same supply and then the Nano will control the power to the lights using a mosfet. My question is, what's the best way to regulate the power to the Nano? 

As far as I can see I have two options:

1. Use a voltage regulator - The L7805 regulator can supposedly handle an input voltage of up to 36v but I've seen websites saying you shouldn't use it with more than 8-9v input because beyond that it will get hot. I could use a heatsink but if it's getting hot does that mean it's inefficient?

2. Use two resistors to make a voltage divider - I only just learned about these and only have a vague understanding of how they work. Would they be affected by the lights going on and off or does the combination of reliable power supply and correctly chosen resistors guarantee the Nano would get a steady 5v?

Any assistance would be hugely appreciated."

arduino,RTC hangs when time is changed,"I'm trying to write code for a time-adjustable Nixie clock. I'm using an Adafruit DS1307 RTC module to keep track of the time, and I'm using the RTClib module to control it. Hours, minutes, and seconds can be adjusted by three separate rotary encoders, and I have interrupts attached to each of them. Whenever one of these interrupts triggers, though, and it tries to call `rtc.adjust()`, the entire program hangs, and the change in time is not registered.

arduino,Using PCA9685 in parallel and for LEDs,"  

Hey you all! I am using two Arduino uno (Elegoo Uno R3) with JMRI for my model railroad. One with DCC++ Ex which works flawlessly, the other one with servo drivers, which connects to a PCA9685 board. Currently I only have a small test circle for driving and two servos for the turnouts, that all works fine. My “real” Layout is planned to be modules, where I will build a train-station first, which is on two modules. I want to have both Arduino under Module #1 and connect modules to the left and right with DBA25 Connectors, every module gets its own PCA9685 for the turnouts and LEDs. Attached you can find my general concept drawing. My first Question is, do I need to connect the PCA9685 boards in series (going from board #1 to #2 to #3) or can I connect both PCA board #2 and #3 to the 6 Exit Pins of Board #1 like in my drawing?   
 Second question is regarding powering servos and LEDs with the same PCA board. Currently the code is set up for PMW for the servos, and connecting a LED will result in a fast flickering light. Is there any component I can use to give the LED a cleaner signal? Maybe with a capacitor?

Thank you so much for reading all of that and helping me out 😊

arduino,How do I use VS Code instead of Arduino IDE?,"The main reason I want to use VS Code is because my eyes get really strained from looking at the thin fonts on a white background in Arduino IDE.

I've installed the Arduino extension from Microsoft, but I don't think it's working yet. For example, I have an analog pin declared as...

    const int potPin1 = A0;

But I get a red swiggle under A0, saying ""identifier A0 is undefined."" Similarly, setting the pin to HIGH or LOW causes the values of HIGH and LOW to be undefined. In Arduino IDE, it's not necessary to define these values; they just are valid values you can assign.

I'm certain I'm missing something, but I don't know what and I haven't had much luck Googling. Can anyone point me to some good ""how to use VS Code for Arduino"" documentation?"
arduino,Need help with coding potentiometer to act as buttons in M. Hieronimus’ Joystick.h library,"Heyyo Hivemind!
Here’s the idea: sliding the pot (sliding, yes, it’s a slide pot) up returns a “up” button being pressed “in software” and sliding it down “presses” the “down” button.
What I have so far: two slide pots, six buttons. The buttons and the “b” pot are working fine as designed. Will post code later in the comments (posting from mobile now). The b pot returns an analog axis value, the buttons return pressed or not. The a pot (the one I want to map as button presses) is currently returning a value between 0 and 7 depending on its location (the plan for the buttons is to increment an in-game value, which only has 7 states).
Limitations: I already assembled the hardware proof of concept from what I have available (may add some buttons). Don’t want to use any sort of linear encoder or add buttons for this purpose, because I have the pots available and on hand. Also using a pot poses a bit of a challenge and gaining this knowledge may be helpful in the future. 
The plan: read the potentiometer and compare values before and now, divide the readings into 7 discreet values. Then compare previous and current value. If the current value is more than previous - the “up” button gets pressed, if it’s less, then “down”. 
Details: this is a discreet controller for a particular game and purpose in-game. Star Citizen. The radar in the game has 7 states of zoom and normally this is controlled by either pressing zoom in or zoom out button, or mouse scroll wheel. The game doesn’t allow this to be controlled via a joystick axis. 
Any help will be greatly appreciated!
Thanks in advance!"

I'm planning on making a robot that can spin up a soccer ball for you, so that when you kick it, you get a ton of curve and you can 'bend it like Beckham' so to speak. I've done some research so far, but the amount of info is overwhelming, and so far I'm only experienced in working with basic Arduino servos.

So far I understand that for powerful applications, I will need a motor and a motor driver+external power source. I'm looking at [this motor](https://www.amazon.com/AUTOTOOLHOME-Torque-Traxxas-Wheels-Electric/dp/B01M58POHF/ref=sxin_11_ac_d_rm?ac_md=0-0-MTJ2IG1vdG9y-ac_d_rm&amp;cv_ct_cx=12v+motor&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=12v+motor&amp;pd_rd_i=B01M58POHF&amp;pd_rd_r=1e645f34-9c62-4ce1-84c5-c07de466c910&amp;pd_rd_w=QG0Ek&amp;pd_rd_wg=zTpyP&amp;pf_rd_p=b0625ac1-ea22-4a1c-8206-57129b08e075&amp;pf_rd_r=8AA5NN7WY6ZF0VXN8STK&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1626468951&amp;sr=1-1-12d4272d-8adb-4121-8624-135149aa9081) because it says it can reach 12k RPM, I think I will realistically need the ball to go &lt;20RPM for this project. I also noticed that these motors don't have advertised torque readings, so I'm just hoping that a high-rpm 'high-torque' motor can handle accelerating my soccer ball.

Also, if I take the spinner out to the field, I would probably want a battery to go with it - the motor takes 12V so something like [this car-style battery](https://www.amazon.com/ML7-12-Battery-Mighty-Brand-Product/dp/B00K8V30D0/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3MSHBhB3EiwAxcaEu4DuNPFw5xuWTMDKNk0edIdO89mvUypD3ydmfv563DQTjWip8Jzo1RoCoJ0QAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=241952438153&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9008156&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=7036064519436759126&amp;hvtargid=kwd-22790131&amp;hydadcr=24664_10400965&amp;keywords=12v+battery&amp;qid=1626469084&amp;sr=8-5) would be appropriate? 

As for the driver, I see some [with knobs](https://www.amazon.com/Onyehn-Voltage-Controller-1803BK-Adjustable/dp/B08XQ22F47/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&amp;keywords=12v+motor+driver&amp;qid=1626469150&amp;sr=8-11) and [without](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-BTS7960-Driver-Arduino-Current/dp/B00WSN98DC/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&amp;keywords=12v+motor+driver&amp;qid=1626469150&amp;sr=8-10). Can someone explain? I'm thinking maybe the ones without require a signal from the Arduino for speed instead?

arduino,Trying to understand stepper motors,"I'm trying to learn as much as I can about stepper motors. I've been reading tutorials and watching youtube videos and I'm just stuck.  I've gotten to that tipping point where I know enough to be dangerous but not enough to understand.  So before I let the smoke out of something or burn down my house I figured I would ask as many questions as I can get answered. I'm just trying to get the basics of moving a stepper motor left and right.

I've got an arduino mega running a xy-160d motor controller.  I'm running 18v to the motor controller.  I'm running this code:

    const int IN1=5;

I've got everything wired correctly and I can get the motor to buzz and vibrate.  Of course the problem is I want to rotate it.

I have also used this code:

arduino,Weird behaviour from different ws2812b strips," 

So normally i use 60 led/m strips but to reduce consumption for this project i went with BTF lighting 30 l/m strips.

I want the strip to be connected in a loop, but the issue here is that the new strip will not work unless i connect power/signal to the very first LED. So if i solder a connector to the second led and connect it to my controller, nothing turns on. BUT if i connect it to the first LED, it works. If i cut the first LED and connect the second LED, it turns on now.

With my older strips (60 led/m i think btf lighting too), i can connect my controller at any point of the strip and every led from that point turns on. So that was i can loop it the way i want (i have to do this due to \[poor\] design constraints)"

arduino,Calling tone within loop doesn't work without a delay,"Hey! I've been trying to build a simple ""mute when button is pressed"" circuit going and have hit a weird state that I'd love to get more understanding on.

When calling `Serial.println` I can see the state is getting updated correctly, albeit very frequently. After adding a 250ms delay, everything worked perfectly. I gradually decreased the delay until it stopped working again (1ms failed). 

I assume I'm calling `tone` too frequently, but I'm really curious what piece of the hardware/software I'm overloading here. What would be the proper way about this?

```C
void setup() {
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  byte currentState = digitalRead(2);

  if(!currentState) {
    tone(4, 400);
  } else {
    noTone(4);
  }
  
  // Doesn't work without at least a 2ms delay.
  delay(2); 
}
```

Would it be better to have a global state flag and only call `tone`/`noTone` when that flag gets flipped? 

```C
byte state = 0;

void loop() {
  byte currentState = digitalRead(2);
  
  if (currentState != state) {
    if (currentState){
      noTone(4);
    } else {
      tone(4, 400);
    }
    state = currentState;
  }
}

arduino,ArduinoLowPower library and serial communication,"I started playing with the ArduinoLowPower library on an Adafruit Feather M0, running the ATSAMD21 processor. Using the External Wakeup example sketch, I was able to get the CPU to sleep and use the interrupt pin to wake it - no issues there.

After it goes to sleep, I lose the serial monitor and can't get it back. I tried putting another `Serial.begin` in the interrupt method, as well as at the beginning of the loop method, but no luck.

The board disconnects from Windows, but when it wakes back up, it reconnects. I make sure to select the correct COM port when opening serial monitor.

`// Declare it volatile since it's incremented inside an interrupt`

`volatile int repetitions = 1;`

  `// Triggers an infinite sleep (the device will be woken up only by the registered wakeup sources)`

  `// The power consumption of the chip will drop consistently`

  `LowPower.sleep();`

  `Serial.println(""OK I'm up"");`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

`void repetitionsIncrease() {`

  `// This function will be called once on device wakeup`

  `// You can do some little operations here (like changing variables which will be used in the loop)`

  `// Remember to avoid calling delay() and long running functions since this functions executes in interrupt context`

(pic attached),"This has been pretty challenging for me, I've been trying to recreate the temperature image from the gif on this [website](https://electropeak.com/learn/absolute-beginners-guide-to-tft-lcd-displays-by-arduino/?unapproved=1078&amp;moderation-hash=3d33710953013ee0d63e8e3d55ef9013#comment-1078). So far I've been able to tweak some of the code to get the circle but not the thermometer. There is a .h file for the thermometer that was turned into a hex file. The bitMap function should display the image but I'm not seeing a complete image, rather the space where it should be and it looks like missingno(should I catch it?). This is the line: tft.drawBitmap(0, 0, Temp, 128, 64, 225); Any help would be greatly appreciated!

arduino,Is there a simple way to get a sense of remaining battery life when voltage is being boosted?,"I've read that in general you can use a voltage divider to an analog pin to get a rough idea of remaining battery life. However since I'm boosting an 18650 to 5v with a boost converter I suspect the output will be 5v till the very end of the charge.

I suppose I could run extra wires to the cell itself and do the divider? Any reason that wouldn't work or be accurate? is there a simpler way? Thanks."
arduino,Struggling to understand this logic.,"    const int TRIGGER_PIN = 13;
    const int LAMP = 2;

    bool lamp_on = false;

    void setup()
    {
    pinMode(LAMP, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(LAMP, lamp_on);
    }

    void loop()
    {
    if (digitalRead(TRIGGER_PIN))
    {
    lamp_on = !lamp_on;
    digitalWrite(LAMP, lamp_on);
    delay(250);
    }
    }

To start, I thought digitalWrite required either a HIGH or LOW value in the second argument.  Yet this is plugging in the boolean value of ‘false’.  I’m guessing false is the same as the value ‘0’ and in turn, the value ‘0’ is the same as ‘LOW’?

Second, 

    if (digitalRead(TRIGGER_PIN))

I’m led to believe an if statement requires two things to compare.  I have no idea exactly what this is doing other than waiting for the trigger button to be pushed.  But I do not understand how it is working exactly.  I added a few lines later to print the result of this command to the serial monitor, and when I press the button, it prints “1”, but shouldn’t it be printing “0” while the button is pushed?

Finally,  I’ve never been able to grasp the concept of statements like lamp_on = !lamp_on.  It’s hard to explain that I get it, but I also don’t get it at the same time.  Is there another more straightforward way of toggling a switch in the language that might make me see this more clearly?

All I’m doing with this is controlling an AC lamp with a relay that is in turn controlled by an arduino.

arduino,Wifi connectivity with nano form factor,"Hello all,

I'm pretty new to all this. I've prototyped a device using a Nano board that monitors water flow and activates a servo to flip a switch if the water flow gets too low. I'd like to add the capability to E-mail me when this happens, but I can't figure out how to get the Nano online. I have a ESP-01 (with ESP8266 chip) but I'm having a very hard time finding anything about how to actually connect it. Like, how do I tell it the wifi name and password, etc? 

I understand that the ESP8266 is it's own microcontroller that runs on 3.3V, so I'm using a power supply with it ([this one](https://www.amazon.com/MELIFE-Breadboard-Supply-Arduino-Solderless/dp/B07X3S4B1W)). I can get it powered on, it lights up, but I can't make it do anything either by itself or through the Nano. 

My main questions:

1. How can I use the ESP-01 just as a device for the Nano to connect to Wifi?

2. OR Can I use the ESP-01 by itself with a power supply to operate two or more modules?

3. Is there a better option for a cheap board that can access wifi and operate multiple modules?

Thanks"

arduino,Dynamic changing the volume of channels base of number of channel playing,"Lets say I have 5 tracks that are equal to the number of Buttons I have.

I would like to constantly check which track are playing and use this data to change the volume of each track. So if I have only 1 track playing the volume will be max. If I have 2 track playing the volume of each track will be 1/2. if I have 3 tracks playing the volume of each track will be 1/3 and so on.

I have this part of the code to declare constant, variables etc

    const int buttonPins[] = {2,3,5}; //array of buttons pins
    const int numOfButtons =  (sizeof(buttonPins) / sizeof(buttonPins[0])); // size of push buttons
    int counter = 0;
    bool lastState[numOfButtons]; // store if track is playing or not

then the void() setup{} that I declaring input and output pins

     Serial.begin(9600);
     for (int i = 0; i &lt;  numOfButtons; i++)
      {
        pinMode(buttonPins[i], INPUT);
      }
    

and the loop section:

     for (int i = 0; i &lt; numOfButtons; i++)
      {
        if (digitalRead(buttonPins[i]) == HIGH)
        {
          if(millis()-buttons_pressed[i]&gt;=minTime)
          {
            buttons_pressed[i]=millis();
            wTrig.trackPlayPoly(i+1); //play track number i poly
            digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);
            Serial.print(""track number: "");
            Serial.print(i+1);
            Serial.println("" Is playing"");
            wTrig.update();
          }
         digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW); // if false = led off
        }
      }

now is the part I'm not sure how to do: I try to store into a boll array only the tracks that currently play and count them into the counter variable. Only if the track was ON  and no longer playing I subtract it from the count:

&amp;#x200B;

    for (int j = 0; j &lt;numOfButtons; j++)
      {
        if(wTrig.isTrackPlaying(j+1))
        {
          counter += 1;
          lastState[j]= 1;
          
        }
        else if(!wTrig.isTrackPlaying(j+1) &amp;&amp; lastState[j] == 1)
        {
          counter -= 1;
          lastState[j] = 0;
        }
      }

This is what I don't manage to do: 

If I have only one track playing - find it and make it play full amplitude, if I have 2 tracks playing - find it and make each of them play 1/2 amplitude.

&amp;#x200B;

    for (int k = 0; k &lt; counter; k++)
      {
        for ( int z = 0 z &lt; sizeof(lastState); z++ )
        {
           if (lastState[z] == 1 &amp;&amp; counter == 1)
           {
             wTrig.trackFade(z, -6, 500, 0);   
           }
        }
      }

arduino,Super Simple Project I need help with,"Hey guys, I have a motor inside a cassette player (Yamaha MT50) that I would like to run at half its current speed, and using a basic 10k potentiometer for this job is just too unstable to create listenable recordings so I wanted to do it with an Arduino Nano. I have very little experience with these however, and I'm not sure if it is possible. I have much more experience with simple electrical components.

I would like to take the voltage going into the motor and bring it down to a defined amount (I will have to find out what voltage thru some tinkering) whenever a physical switch is flipped, however if the switch is off it should simply bypass the voltage and leave it unaffected. Also it would be nice to have an LED turn on when the switch is flipped.
It seems easy but im not sure if it is possible to reduce/deliver a specific voltage in a kind of accurate way using a nano. 
The entire cassette deck itself runs on DC 12V and im using a basic SPDT On-On switch to control it."

arduino,Where can I buy Bluetooth Low Energy gadgets.,"I made a Javascript script that allows me to easily make websites that communicate with BLE capable devices. I can write and read from my Arduino 33 IoT but in theory, my website can communicate with any  BLE peripheral.

I watched this talk on BLE: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDc5HUVMI5U&amp;t=1315s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDc5HUVMI5U&amp;t=1315s) and this guy has BLE LED Matrices, BLE smart lamps, BLE lego robots etc etc. I wanted to know if anyone knew of some cheap BLE toy that would allow me to learn. Preferably something really simple like a tiny LED matrix or a smart night lamp.

I looked online and all I could find were zoomer Bluetooth LED strips to hang in your room while making TikToks. Those are fine but they were all Bluetooth and not Bluetooth BLE as far as I can tell."

arduino,Need some advice from this community,"Hey folks, thanks for taking the time to read my post. I need help from this community to reprogram a circuit board, which looks to me like an Arduino. I'm not sure if that's even possible, so I wanted to check with some Arduino experts before spending too much time on this project.

Here's a picture of the board, which almost looks like an Arduino. Correct me if I'm mistaken. [https://imgur.com/a/QuvXHeB](https://imgur.com/a/QuvXHeB)

Quick rundown:

I purchased this scoreboard and want to repurpose it for my family's cornhole league.[https://www.popashot.net/product-category/accessories/scoring-electronics/](https://www.popashot.net/product-category/accessories/scoring-electronics/)

The main issue is that the board is programmed for basketball scoring, which means each ""point"" increases by incrementals of 2. For example, if you score 3 points, it displays 6 instead of 3. Ideally, I would need to find a way to connect into the board's program to change this increment, so it can increase by 1 instead.

Additionally, the scoreboard shuts of automatically after a few minutes of inactivity. I would also like to change this delay.


It has a few connectors that almost looks like ethernet ports, that can control the On/Off, the audio, etc.

Can anyone enlighten me? Is this even possible? 

Cheers!"

The communication needs to be only half-duplex, because they send commands and receive responses, but only one Arduino sends commands.

arduino,what is going on my the baud rate,"ok so i'm putting together this DIY helicopter controller project with pro mini's inside and i'm at the stage where there is a debug feature with the serial to check all the wiring of the switches.

1.I upload the pro mini with the FTDI thingy and leave it plugged in for the serial info 

2.I open serial at the default 9600 baud and nothing but jiberish comes out (sqares and ?). I SHOULD have a bunch of ones and zero that react to each individual switches

i turn on the serial and it's nothing but jiberish coming out.. 

&amp;#x200B;

out of ideas, i play with each baud rate and at 4800.. boom i see my lines of 0's and 1's.

&amp;#x200B;

the guy says that it should be at 9600 as per the script.

&amp;#x200B;

the next step won't work, I have no idea what is wrong there. and while playing with my other PC trying to troubleshoot  the wire from the FTDI started to become really hot. i thing that arduino is fried..

i used the cable to charge my PS3 controller. (usb mini B is kinda rare nowaday)

arduino,Flickering LEDs with shift register,"Hi, so I'm using shift register for the first time, and well, first times cannot be that easy...

All my LEDs that are connected to shift register flickers - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKQzBJOjSHs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKQzBJOjSHs) (the first one doesn't, as it's directly connected to arduino digital pin). 

As far as I read max is 70mA, I'm using 1.2k resistors, so with yellow LEDs it's around 2mA for single LED, so 16mA for all LEDs, it should be ok. If I'm wrong, please tell me, I'm quite new in terms of electronic, so I'm still learning. :)

As I searched in google there were some solutions with capacitors - which I'm not using currently, I don't even have any, so I'm not able to check it... Also I'm not exactly sure where such capacitor should be, as I saw solutions with capacitor between Vcc and GND and STCP and GND (but as far as I understand, the latter is wrong).

The thing is, is it about capacitor? It's not that accesible for me, so before I buy it an online shop or go for looong ride to stationary shop I'd rather be sure it will help..."

Materials

• Ameba D \[RTL8722 CSM/DM\] x 1  
• Adafruit PDM MEMS microphone  
• LED x 4

Example

**Procedure**

Connect the microphone and LEDs to the RTL8722 board following the diagram.

Download the Ameba customized version of TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers library at [https://github.com/ambiot/ambd\_arduino/tree/master/Arduino\_zip\_libraries](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/tree/master/Arduino_zip_libraries).  
Follow the instructions at [https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries) to install it.  
Ensure that the patch files found at [https://github.com/ambiot/ambd\_arduino/tree/master/Ameba\_misc/](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/tree/master/Ameba_misc/) are also installed.  
Open the example, “Files” -&gt; “Examples” -&gt; “TensorFlowLite\_Ameba” -&gt; “micro\_speech”.

&amp;#x200B;

Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is finished.  
Once it is running, you should see one of the LEDs flashing, indicating that it is processing audio. Saying the word “yes” will cause the green LED to light up. Saying the word “no” will cause the red LED to light up. If the word is not recognized, the blue LED will to light up.  
The inference results are also output to the Arduino serial monitor, which appear as follows:

If you are having trouble in getting the words recognized, here are some tips:  
– Ensure that your surroundings are quiet with minimal noise.  
– Experiment with varying the distance of the microphone, starting with it at an arm’s length.  
– Experiment with different tones and volume when saying the words.  
– Depending on how you pronounce the words, the characteristics of the microphone used, getting one keyword recognized may be easier than the other.

arduino,BiDirectional Direction counter using Arduino and 2 HC-SR04(UV) sensors," Hello,

I am trying to implement people counter using arduino and uv sensors. I am referring this already done project by some university students for the implementation [https://github.com/PEOPLE-INSIDE/people-inside](https://github.com/PEOPLE-INSIDE/people-inside) .

The implementation is as follows,

1. Read the first 100 data points and store them in an array . Calculate average distance and upper lowerbound for the two uv sensors.
2. Suppose the sensors are A and B. If the A sensor detects a person first, it means *IN*. And the reverse, of course it means *OUT*.
3. Find out the direction using the following formula:

I am a casual r/arduino browser, but an avid mechanical keyboard guy. There is some crossover in our communities, so I thought I would post this here.  
I am in the process of designing a new bluetooth module, that is more DIY focused than other currently available options, and have an Interest Check going on right now to find out more about whether there is an appetite for it outside the keyboard community.  


**Photos:**  


[Prototype render. There will be a metal RF shield over the components](https://preview.redd.it/ghdcbtwex0b71.jpg?width=1763&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06a7489ab1f068ba9de6990762008c734ccb7ebd)

**The Details:**  
This module is designed to be soldered either directly to a PCB or to a shield/daughterboard that is pin compatible with other footprints. Here are some specifications:

\- based on the Nordic nRF52840 SOC ([https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF52840\_PS\_v1.2.pdf](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF52840_PS_v1.2.pdf))  
\- can be powered by voltages from 1.7 to 5.5V  
\- internal LDO and DC/DC regulators available if desired  
\- SWD pins exposed for programming. Compatible with Adafruit nrf uf2 bootloader allowing drag and drop (or wireless OTA) firmware updates  
\- exposed pins to attach a NFC antenna if so desired  
\- Dimensions: 12.0mm (W) x 19.2mm (H) x 2.75mm thick  
\- 38 broken out GPIO pins... all are hand solderable!  
\- 12 more pins broken out with dedicated uses  


**Why a new module?**

There are a lot of modules out there to choose from, and many of them are great. The biggest issue I had, and the reason for this module, is they are not incredibly easy to use in small scale or DIY situations. With the bottom solder pads, which in many cases comprises of almost half of available GPIO, it is virtually impossible for the common person to solder.

This module has most of the bottom pads broken out into small pin mount holes, to facilitate hand soldering, and prevent the expensive PCBA (PCB assembly) process for one-offs or prototypes. If a production run was desired and it made sense to use a factory's PCBA service, then the pads have been retained on the bottom of the module, and work just as well for machine SMD soldering.

I have also laid out the GPIOs on the castellated edges in a somewhat symmetrical layout. This may not be a huge advantage so some people, but in the keyboard community, this was a huge plus.

It is possible to use other modules with hand soldering, but you will miss out on all the bottom GPIO pads if you do not have an oven or hotplate. If you discount the bottom pads, then this module breaks out almost double the amount of available GPIO.

**Wrap Up**

So that is the gist of it. There is a bunch more information on my Interest Check form, as well as some questions that I would love to have answered, if you are so inclined. The form can be submitted anonymously if you desire, and if you don't, your info will only be used to update you on the status of this project. 

The plan is to have these as an in-stock item, so no pre-sale or group buy required.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks in advance if you decide to fill out the form.

arduino,"Servo ""wandering"" while arduino sleeps","Hi arduinauts, I have a free-motion servo hooked up to an arduino with a simple sketch that basically does this in a loop:

1. Spin the servo for a random, short (&lt; 3s) duration.
2. Stop the servo
3. Sleep for a random, longer-but-still-short (30s - 15min) duration.

During step 3, occasionally the servo will wander - it will move in very small, very short steps. Configurations below have been tested, in each case the servo is hooked up directly to the arduino. All configurations end with the same result:

* Arduino powered by laptop
* Arduino powered by 9v battery
* Arduino powered by 5v powerbank

My guess is that the servo is picking up stray control impulses from somewhere during the sleep phase, but it might also be that the servo just needs independent power. I've adjusted the sleep duration up and down and it doesn't seem to make a difference - eventually, the servo will just get frisky while it's supposed to be asleep.

So are my guesses totally wild? If the servo is receiving stray control impulses, is there any way to prevent them?

I can post the sketch if needed but it's little more complex than the behaviour above."

So, the thing is, im trying to build a device that regulates voltage in a way that it increastes from 0 to max and from max to zero. I have this mosfet driver: [https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07VRCXGFY/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o05\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07VRCXGFY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Now there are some strange things happening...

 \* The output Voltage is 20V and not 18V as i would expect.  
 \* My ""easing in"" curve goes like this (and this is more important to me than the max voltage)  
  \---0.05V (a little bit remaining voltage because Arduinos PIN5)  
  \---12V (right when i start writing my first PWM input which should be 1 in that case)  
  \---12V to 20 like i would expect it to happen from 0 to 20

My code for the PWM control is like this, should be correct i guess...

\`\` 

 unsigned long lastTick = millis();  
 int pwmOut = 0;  
 float interval = turnOnDurationMS / 255;

while (pwmOut &lt; 255)  
  {  
 if (millis() &gt; lastTick + interval)  
    {  
 lastTick = millis();  
 pwmOut++;  
 analogWrite(pwmPIN, pwmOut);  
    }  
  }

\`\`

arduino,New Nano breakout board,"I have a new Nano breakout board.

Headers are included for all of the IO pins. It has room for pullup resistors for SDA (A4) and SCL (A5). The regulator space is for the 1117 LDO type 5v/1a. The regulator is optional and the VIN header goes to the VIN pin of the Nano and lets the onboard regulator do the powering. You will have to solder the jumper pad to use a regulator.  If a regulator is not used, then VIN EXT can be used for external ""V"" pin header powering. This will allow for more power/voltage for servos or other devices.

The gerbers can be found here [https://github.com/jscottb/pcbs](https://github.com/jscottb/pcbs) along with others I have made.

To adjust the speed of my pivot, I set the percentage timer to either a higher or lower value to let it run a greater or lower percentage of a minute. Any idea how I would do this with arduino?

arduino,Connecting a HX8357 TFT to ESP32,"Hi,

I bought a HX8357 TFT panel from AliExpress that came with an Arduino Uno and it worked but was too slow to update the screen. I though that using an ESP32 would make it faster as it is faster than the Arduino. The problem is that the maker of the TFT panel don't have any libraries to work with an ESP32. I tried the [TFT\_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) library from GitHub and changed the `User_Setup.h` to use the pins that I'm connecting it to but the screen is always black.

What am I doing wrong?

This is the schematics of what I'm doing (please ignore the SD card reader):

arduino,Need help on a multi watering system I want to make,"Hi,

First of all, thanks for the interest! Ok. I have a small apartment garden, which has several pots. I want to water them independently, depending on how much water each needs.

First of all, I'm a noob in coding and a total 0 in using Arduino. But I saw that most of the tutorials on the internet about this matter are made using Arduino, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Most of them are for a single plant pot, but really, how owns only one flower? I need something for my many plant pots (around 4-5).

Besides the unhelpful single-pot tutorials, I found [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdvnfENodak) that tackles my exact need. But the thing is that in the wiring diagram that he uses (\~ min 1:11) there's no breadboard, but at the end, when he tests the project, he uses one (\~min 5:19). That set me off since I have no idea how this works. I thought I'll do the exact same thing he did, I even went online and added all the stuff from the diagram in the cart, but then I saw that he uses a breadboard too and it set me off... 

Can someone help me with this? Are his diagram and code good enough for what I need (4-5 separate pots)? What's with the breadboard at the end? Can anyone give me a full diagram with everything I need for this?

arduino,Receiving data and controlling the Arduino Uno R3 wirelessly through a website (MEAN stack),"Hi all! 

I'm a relative newbie to Arduino. I have experience in C, JavaScript and other web development related languages e.g HTML. 

I am working on a dissertation project that requires me to integrate an existing Arduino Uno R3 with a website as well as a database. My goal is to be able to read data outputted by the relevant sensors connected to the Arduino. Another objective is to control certain processes of the Arduino from said website. 

I am hoping to be pointed in the right direction when it comes to making the link between the Web server and the Arduino. 

So far, I have explored connecting a WiFi module, such as the ESP8266 to the Arduino Uno R3. Another avenue I have explored is switching to the Arduino Uno WiFi REV2. 

I am struggling with connecting the Arduinos to a web server over the wifi and passing data across wirelessly. Currently I am following a tutorial that is POSTing the data to a webserver through a php script. I plan to using that technique to instead POST to an API that can be used by my Angular website. 

But anyway, if you have come across similar projects, or used any helpful tutorials/resources, or would be able to provide any insights as well as advice, I'd very much appreciate it!

The project I'm working on uses Bluetooth to talk to two separate Arduinos. One is outside collecting data while the other receives the data and displays it inside. I've been bouncing between [these](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/how-to-configure-pair-two-hc-05-bluetooth-module-master-slave-commands/) two [websites](https://osoyoo.com/2018/07/13/hc-02-bluetooth-4-0-ble-slave-module-to-uart-transceiver-arduino-compatible-with-android-ios/) for a couple of days to get a better idea of how the HC sensors work. 

I'm having trouble understanding how the master and slave will be ""hooked"" up together. When the HC-02 module is plugged in it continuously flashes, so I believe it's in 'Waiting for connection in Data Mode', according to the [website](https://osoyoo.com/2018/07/13/hc-02-bluetooth-4-0-ble-slave-module-to-uart-transceiver-arduino-compatible-with-android-ios/). Since my computer can find it when I pull up the Bluetooth devices near me, is there anything to set up, per se, for the slave (HC-02), or will the master (HC-06) find it and seamlessly send data over my flawless vision (/s)? I bring this up because I'm having trouble entering the HC-02's Command Mode. I'm on Mac and using the cu. port currently (also tried the Bluetooth one), changed the bauds, and clicked ""both NL &amp; CR"" and it remained blank when I typed anything into the serial monitor box.

Also wasn't sure which 'help' flair this should've been."

Essentially, what happens is when I plug the motor controller into the arduino, the LED on the controller goes on and everything seems fine. but as soon as I plug the motor into the controller, the LED on the controller goes off, and the LEDs on the uno get really dim, or turn off.

I've tried having the motor controller plugged into both the 3.3v and 5v pins on the uno. the uno *is* plugged into my PC, rather than a battery so it could be that it's trying to draw more current than the USB is providing but at the same time, since it's plugged into 3.3v/5v pins it should only draw that amount of current right?

arduino,Request for suggestions: Alternatives to Hall effect flow sensors,"TL:DR version:  I am looking for a flow sensor that will report water flow but is not sensitive enough to report flow when only air is in the lines.

Hello:

I am working on an alert system for an eFoil I will be building - one that will detect and alert (visual and audio) for problems such as a leak, loss of cooling water to the ESC/motor controller, etc.

I had thought the cooling water flow portion would be pretty easy, but unfortunately the prevalent Hall effect flow sensors are a little TOO good - they will sense flow and send pulses to the Arduino even with only air running through the lines, so they aren't going to be effective for this use case.

Some alternatives I have looked at:

*  The available pressure sensors I have seen are meant for a much larger pressure gradient than what my system would experience, so unless I wanted to deliberately place a restriction in my cooling system output line in order to artificially increase pressure (which would create more potential fail points), they won't work.
* I thought about using an EC/TDS sensor, but that would be extremely difficult to dial in since the eFoil would be used in both fresh and salt water
* I will have a temp sensor in the output flow, but by the time the outgoing stream starts heating up significantly, I am likely already well on my way to an overheated motor controller. I am hoping to catch coolant flow issues right when they happen instead of only after the flow issue has gotten severe enough to start overheating the controller.

Has anyone come across some kind of flow sensor that is less reactive to air in the lines, or maybe an alternate implementation method for accomplish the goal?

I am appreciative of any suggestions!"

In this project, PIR sensor (The PIR Motion sensor module is an automatic control module based on infrared technology) and IR sensor (IR Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module has a pair of infrared transmitting and receiving tubes). The DFPlayer Mini module was used to play audio files. (The DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player For Arduino is a small and low price MP3 module with an simplified output directly to the speaker) We used one 9V battery for power consumption and one mini speaker for audio files. We chose DIP components for the PCB, so it became an easily solderable board. Of course, this project includes one Atmega328P microcontroller and the minimum required component.

arduino,Why use Capacitive Library?,"So I am trying to make a simple capicitive sensor using aluminium foil. I noticed that I actually don't need library at all. I can just touch the resistor with any conductor and it works as an input. 

Is there something I am missing here?"
arduino,looking for help with a remote control car project,"im looking to control a remote control car using arduino, i have opened up the remote control cars controller and got the pcb with buttons on it, by connecting wires to the contacts on the buttons and putting them on a breadboard i want to be able to send a signal with arduino to these wires and ""connect them electronically"" lol, i believe a transistor switch does that and i am looking for help choosing which transistor i need and the layout to put it all in, thanks"
arduino,Exception Decoder help - ESP8266 NodeMCU + BME680 Webserver,"Following this [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-nodemcu-bme680-web-server-arduino/) and everything goes according to plan: With the serial monitor I can see the system connecting to the internet, show me the IP where the website is being hosted, and it gives me readings every 30 seconds.

The problem comes when I try to access the website. As soon as the website tries to load, the system seems to literally panic and then reset.

The output from the Exception Decoder is below, and the code for the ESP8266 is in the tutorial page  (opting not to post here since it's relatively long -- let me know if I should). Might be obvious or actually completely wrong, but the problem seems to be when the website asks ESP to get readings. Or maybe it's the loop(). Maybe runs out of memory? HELP!

arduino,Need suggestions on cool Arduino projects that I can include in a high school electronics class. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.,"I teach a high school digital electronics class and am looking for more interesting projects the kids would enjoy doing.  By the time we get to Arduino's, they do have decent soldering skills and are good with bread boards.  I also have access to 3D printers for parts.

Most of the kids have no prior experience with this stuff so I have been starting with the blink example to get them used to navigating the IDE, and then build up from there.  Next I have them add a pushbutton and external LED and once they have the code modified  for that,  I have them swap out the push button with some different sensors (proximity, motion and accelerometer) so they have to maker minor code changes to read the sensor inputs.  Then I have them control 4 different LED's with a joystick.  Once they are good with this, I have them write code  to control the traffic lights at an intersection using pushbuttons to simulate the sensors that detect when cars are present.  


At this point I have them all pick a personal project that they want to do.  Things like automatic pet food dispensers and robotic arms controlled with smartphone apps.


I am looking for more interesting projects that the kids would like to do so if you have any suggestions, I would appreciate it. Thanks!"
arduino,Looking for some help coding a IR Camera,"  

I am in need some coding help. I am working on an Arduino fire truck. I originally used a 5-way flame sensor, but have learned that this is too sensitive to ambient light. I thought a IR sensor for a digital IR thermometer may be better so I picked up a AMG8833 IR 8\*8 Infrared Sensor Camera Module Thermal Imager Array Temperature Sensor Module IIC I2C 3-5V from Aliexpress. I am trying to figure out how to code it. 

What I would like to have happen is if the camera picks up a temperature above a set limit to have the truck move back and forth until the highest temperature is located in the center of the camera, then stop moving. 

Currently what is supposed to happen with the flame sensor is that if one of the sensors detects a flame the truck stops, then moves back and forth until the flame is located in the center. Then it moves forward or back until the flame is a set distance away. 

Related, if someone can help me figure out how to make the flame sensor work that would be cool too. It has a larger arc than the thermal camera."

arduino,I need small confirmation before buying the WAV Trigger (with Arduino Mega),"I'm planning to use the WAV Trigger With arduino Mega.  [Here](https://github.com/robertsonics/WAV-Trigger-Arduino-Serial-Library) is the library available for it.

I want to connect around 20 - 25 push buttons to the Arduino Mega and with that to trigger different audio files stored in the WAV Trigger.  No more then 10 files will be triggered at the same time. 

Can I do the above ?  Will it be possible to write a code that relate each button to a different audio file?

Can I transmit all of this button state via the serial pin ?

arduino,Cloning 868MHz remote,"tl;dr: I need help matching OOK encoding with a RFM69 radio.

I've bought a ceiling fan that uses an RF remote tuned to - according to my SDR - 868MHz. I'm trying to clone it's signal with a 868MHz Feather M0 which utilises a RFM69HCW radio.

I've tried many libraries and sample projects but have been unable to receive the remote's signal with the RF69 and because of this I'm unable to clone the signal properly.

**Modulation**

rtl\_433 identifies the remote as  Pulse Width Modulation with fixed period and on 868.1 MHz. I've managed to transmit a signal from the Feather with pertty similar modulation as seen in the outputs below:

arduino,ATtiny85 problem dealing with IRremote and Servo," 

Recently I'm trying to make remote control light switch.  
Using an old remote controller to sends signals to the circuit based on ATtiny85, then trigger the servo to click the switch.  
But when I'm trying to load the code from Arduino to Attiny85 ,It shows a bunch of error regarding of timers.

After doing some research, I guess it is the library  or  the ATtiny core that lead to this problem. But sadly, I couldn't find any library or ATtiny core that'll work.

Here's my code

&amp;#x200B;

`#include&lt;IRremote.h&gt;`

`#include &lt;Servo.h&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

`Servo myservo;`

`IRrecv irrecv(2);`

`decode_results results;`

&amp;#x200B;

`void setup() {`

  `myservo.attach(5);`

  `irrecv.enableIRIn();`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

`void loop() {`

  `if(irrecv.decode(&amp;results))`

  `{`

`if(results.value==2105377915)`

`{`

`myservo.write(180);`

`delay(900);`

`myservo.write(0);`

`}`

  `}`

  `irrecv.resume();`

  `delay(100);`

`}`

When I was trying to load the code above, the IDE show that the 'Serial' was not declared in this scope.

So I deleted all the 'Serial.println' in the library. It turned out to have more error about timer. And that's pretty hard for me, a rookie for Arduino , to understand and modify the library.

arduino,Question about Strings,"I've just started learning about the world of arduino and am a bit confused about Strings. I know that there are strings (the char arrays which are null terminated) and Strings (String objects, which allow more functionality but also use up more ram), and I'm confused about Strings (String objects).   


So basically, I'm not sure what the difference between these 2 ways of declaring Strings are,   
 

`String a = ""hello"";`

`String b = String(""hello"");`

I checked the Arduino website, and it says:   
""All of the following are valid declarations for Strings.""     and provides the following code example:

    String stringOne = ""Hello String"";                    // using a constant String String stringOne = String('a');                       // converting a constant char into a String String stringTwo = String(""This is a string"");        // converting a constant string into a                 String object
    String stringOne = String(stringTwo + "" with more"");  // concatenating two strings
    String stringOne = String(13);                        // using a constant integer 
    String stringOne = String(analogRead(0), DEC);        // using an int and a base String stringOne = String(45, HEX);                   // using an int and a base (hexadecimal) 
    String stringOne = String(255, BIN);                  // using an int and a base (binary) 
    String stringOne = String(millis(), DEC);             // using a long and a base String stringOne = String(5.698, 3);                  // using a float and the decimal places

The code example in the website says String() is converting a constant string into a String object and String a = ""Hello"" is using a constant String, which I do not understand.

So are they the exact same thing except String() has more functionality because it can be used in more cases?  I'm very confused, please explain as thoroughly as possible

arduino,Arduino OOP: Cross-reference classes (objects),"**TLDR:** *Can't cross-reference objects in different files with OOP.*  
*I created classes (interface?) with .h file and added logic + filled variables with .cpp files.*  
*Even while including Object2.h (or .cpp) in Object1.h I get errors.*

Today I had my first real shot at OOP (Object Oriented Programming) with Arduino  
I split my classes into files, but it seems like I can't cross-reference them.

So in 'Object1.h' I can include 'Object2.h', but I will still get the error: 'Object2' does not name a type.  
In my main code I can reference the objects, and I even had them working with both variables and logic.  
I also tried to include both the .h and .cpp files, but no luck there.

I used this website as an example for the basics of OOP within Arduino:

arduino,Sending serial data from arduino to esp8266-01,"Hello. I am using an ESP8266 to send and receive data from a server to an arduino.
The ESP can send serial data just fine using Serial.print commands.

However, when I try to send serial data from the Arduino to the ESP, the ESP keeps rebooting.

I have verivifed the power source and I am using a voltage divider to shift the logic level of the Arduino TX pin to the ESP rx pin. 

The code on the ESP receives a number and then adds 1 to it and sends it back through the Serial. (at 9600 baud) 

After some testing I pinned down the moment the ESP is rebooting to when the code should read the data from the serial Rx pin. 

I am using the actual rx/tx pins on the Arduino Uno, not softwareSerial 

I have verified the code using two arduinos and it works correctly so I don't think the code is the problem. 

Has anyone encountered a similar problem? Or knows of a possible solution?"

I'm hoping for a travel time of about a second or less.

Correct me if any of the below is wrong, but these are the ideas I've had so far.

- A spur gear on a servo would require the gear to have a circumference of 14 inches, which would be over 4 inches in diameter, which is pretty big.  Some kind of gear box could work but would be overly complicated.

- Linear servos seem like more trouble than they're worth, I'm not too familiar with them.

- Solenoids require constant power to remain engaged

- Stepper motors are seeming like a good option right now

Any suggestions?"
arduino,Stepper motor only turns one direction,"I have a nema 17 stepper motor run by an A4988 driver and an arduino. The motor turns in one direction, but when it goes to turn the other, it vibrates and sounds like it's grinding or something. If I only use one of the coils by only using 1 pair of wires I can get it to turn one direction, then using the other pair of cables on the same output of the A4988 driver the motor vibrates and grinds. Has anyone had this happen before? (I've also tried switching the position of the defective pair (+/- &gt; -/+))"

arduino,Advice on sensors for an air quality monitor?,"A little while back I grabbed an SDS011 and a PMS3003 with the intent of creating a basic air quality monitor. I recently rediscovered them in my project box and got them up and running pretty quick with some NodeMCUs. 


Both are nice in their own ways but I want to see what the collective wisdom is here concerning AQI sensors. What are some good ones to shop around for? 
Are there any good ones that also cover VOCs so I can calculate a more accurate AQI with my monitoring? 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm aiming to build 2, maybe 3 stations (one to measure air quality of outside air, one the AQI in my living room level of my home, and one for the bedroom level of my home).  

Here is a quick list of what I like and dislike about the 2 sensors I have now:

SDS011:
good: seems to actually sleep (in that the fan actually shuts off), delivers data as floating point numbers, was really easy to use, connector that was easy to connect to (I can just use a DuPont connector with it)
Bad: bulky, lots of exposed parts

&amp;nbsp;

PMS3003:
Good: Pretty small and self contained, has an extra 1.0um measurement channel.


Bad: integer data only, it was a bit harder to find a good library, I can't tell if it is actually sleeping (the fan never shuts off)."

arduino,Is my Arduino capable of monitoring this motor encoder?,"I have a standard [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano) and I am having a hard time reading from a motor's encoder. On paper, I feel like it should be capable, but it seems to be missing interrupts and isn't counting properly. 

Here's my calculations:

The motor has a max RPM of 380 and the encoder has 1440 increments per revolution. 

380 x 1440 x 2 x 2 = 2188800 == ~2.2 MHz

380 and 1440 are known. Multiplied by 2 because of the two encoder channels (A and B), then multiplied by 2 again for Nyquist's theorem. As I understand it, the minimum sampling rate I need is 2.2 MHz. 

My Arduino has a clock speed of 16 MHz. Of course, I can't expect all of that speed, I have to account for overhead and the rate in which the interrupts can be polled (which, to be honest, I wasn't able to find out). But surely (if I calculated things correctly) there is enough difference between 2.2 and 16 MHz that this should be possible, no?

I have dropped some example code at the end of the post. It's very barebone, but in the example the motor is spinning at full speed (380 RPM), and I have created the interrupt to be polled when a rise and fall peak is detected (also tested using the 'CHANGE' function). Once the encoder count reaches 2880 (which should be a rotation of 180 deg) the code ends.

If the full RPM is not possible, I have also added a a voltage divider to the pin of velocityControl, which has dropped the speed to 8x slower (~50 RPM), but still what I am pulling from channels A and B on the encoder are not coming in the right order (like you'd expect from the 90 deg shifted square waves). 

The encoder pins are going straight to the Arduino, so no resistors or pullup/down. I have monitored the signals from encoder using an oscilloscope, and they look pretty clean (and as expected). 

Finally, I have received this motor as a development board, which came with an STM32Nucleo. The demo running on the Nucleo works well, so I know it's possible. I just need to know if the limitation is the Arduino hardware, or if I have failed to set the software up correctly. The Nucleo has a significantly faster STM32 processor.

arduino,Replacing HC05 with HC06,"I'm working on a project that uses a HC05 module to communicate with the Android app. Everything was working fine until I made a PCB and soldered everything on it. Suddenly, Arduino can only send data through the BT module, and when I try to receive the data through it, it won't even recognize the incoming data (Serial.available() returns false). I checked the connections on the PCB, and everything seems to be fine. The connections between Arduino and HC05 are:  
TX-&gt;RX  
RX-&gt;TX  
Vcc-&gt;Vcc  
GND-&gt;GND  
Since everything was working fine before soldering, I concluded that I probably fried the RX pin of the BT module while soldering.   
Since the module isn't working now, I wanted to buy another one, but the only availabe option at the moment is the HC06.  
Can I buy the HC06 and just solder it on the PCB instead of the current HC05?

From my understanding, the Arduino Nano needs 5V, which I would provide using the mini-USB port and the motor needs between 8-35V, which I'd supply with a 12V/2A transformer connected with the A4988 driver. However, would it be possible to connect the 12V power supply both to Vin on the Nano AND the A4988 driver, so that it powers both the arduino and motor?
Would the power be sufficient also to light up the LCD?
Thank you!"
arduino,Parallel vs Series,"Hi, I've been experiencing parallel and series circuits on Tinkercad so I could understand the limits of ""resistorless"" LEDs.

\- I linked 4 1.5V 3A AA batteries in series, and 4 others in paralel.  
\- I  put a LED at the end of both circuits.  
\- Finally, I connected 2 multimeter in each in order to read voltage and current.

First, I tried to run those circuits without LEDs, parallel gave me 1.5V 12A, series 6V 3A, then this is what happened when I connected back LEDs :  
\- Parallel circuit on, the LED turned on a little bit, I read 1.5V, 0A.  
\- Series circuit on, the LED broke, I read 5.03V, 487mA.

These results seem strange, shouldn't I get 0V, 20mA on parallel and 3.5V, 487mA on series ?  
Anyway, this experiment allowed me to understand that wattage may be more important than voltage and current, isn't it ? Because in the case of parallel circuit high current (12A) but low voltage (1.5) didn't burn the LED, it take just what it needed.  
But, on the other hand, I'm wondering : Series circuit had a lower current input (3A) but a higher voltage (6V) and the LED died, does it mean that voltage ""pushes"" current stronger, forcing its way through component, therefore breaking it (LED trying to get 20mA but ""accidentally"" taking  more) ?

I don't know if i've been clear, but here's a picture of the circuits so you can see what I did (I know it's not good looking, it was just some tests, not real pinouts).

So, in short, here are my questions :

\- Why did I read these results ?  
\- Is wattage more important than voltage and current ?  
\- Why did the LED broke on series but not in parallel ?  
\- Is voltage ""forcing"" current through components when high enough ?

Sorry if it seems goofy, I'm beginner, and sorry if I made mistakes, english is not my mother tongue.  
Thanks for reading all of this (if you did), and thanks for your future answers (if I get some).

arduino,Arduino door sensor with reed switch and ESP8266?,"Before I code anything or buy parts I want to know if I have thought this out well enough.  


I need around 6 door / window sensors for my home. My home is detached and is at the end of a dead end road. There are 2 other houses located near me, and as a result there is almost no traffic. I'm away from home a lot and want to secure my house the best I can. I have 1 security camera and I'm planning on buying one or two more.  


Basically I want to integrate the sensors into the Home Assistant app so that I get a notification when my door opens. My thought was: Arduino Pro Mini + ESP8266 + Reed Switch + Magnet. So when my door or window opens, the magnetic field of the magnet opens or closes the reed switch. The Arduino and ESP8266 will power on after the reed switch being closed (making contact). It will then proceed to communicate that the door / window has been opened, stay active for a certain amount of time then power down again. I also need to add something so that the Arduino's don't power on when I'm home and open a door or window. I'm not sure how I'm going to do that yet. I'm thinking 1 AA battery will be enough since it will only (if ever) power on once or a few times at most.  


I have 2 NRF24L01s laying around. Using NRF24L01s, I would still need a MAIN Arduino with NRF24L01 &amp; ESP8266 so that it can collect every NRF24L01's signals and then proceed to send the data. I don't think this is a good idea so I will stick to the idea that every Arduino has an ESP8266 and communicates directly instead of needing an NRF24L01. Correct me if I'm dumb here.

  
Am I missing something or is something totally wrong with this? Also how do I incorporate a ""I'M HOME"" switch so that it doesn't turn on and power doesn't get drawn when I'm home, because I don't fancy replacing the batteries every week."

I'm trying to plug both a [DFplayer Mini(3.2-5v according to spec sheet)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BDD8BF3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and a [HC-06(3.6-6V, although it also says it has an operating voltage of 3.3v)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VL6ZH67/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

When I plug either/both of these into the nano itself; using the ground and either the 3.3v or the 5v pin on the nano, neither powers on. the nano stays on but the devices don't. However. If instead of plugging the battery terminals directly into the nano's vin and ground pins, and instead use the breadboard to create a positive and negative rail, and plug all of the vin/VNN and ground pins into THAT; plus bypassing the nano itself for power output, everything turns on fine.

But I'm curious if this might damage the battery, or the chips somehow? I'm pretty new to electrical stuff, so I'm a little worried about bypassing the nano's power output.

arduino,FastLED and WS2811 Help Needed on NodeMCU V3 ESP8266 ESP-12E Development Board,"I am a beginner with Arduino and am looking to start a project.  I come from a programming background, but it is the interfacing with hardware where my knowledge falls short.  My intention for this project is to use an ESP8266 board to host a web server which I can use to control multiple addressable LEDs on a strip with WS2811 chips in series.  The LEDs run on 12v and the development board runs on 3.3v.  I plan to use a buck converter to downstep the voltage for the arduino and power it all off one power supply.  


Currently I am just trying to get the LED code figured out and stable using the FastLED blink example.  I have cut off 2 sections of the LED strip and modified the code to blink the first section red and the second black, wait half a second, and flip the red and off LED segments.  My code is posted below.  


The two main problems I am encountering are:  
a. Consistency, unplugging the LED power supply and replugging it in may or may not turn the LEDs back on.  Uploading new code may or may not make the LEDs turn on, and they may or may not be performing the blink or just solid colours.  Also, it will randomly stop blinking and pick back up.  I have a serial output in the loop and that continues while the LEDs stop so it isn't the Arduino stuttering.

b. The actual colour itself.  Currently I have it in a semi-working state (inconsistent looping, but at least some blinking is happening) but the colour being output is Blue instead of Red.  Presumably this is an issue with how I have the RGB defined, and I haven't looked too deep into this issue yet as I believe the consistency in the output of the code is more important than fixing the RGB values.  


I also have a video of the blinking issue but Reddit doesn't seem to think my .mp4 file is a .mp4 file and won't let me upload it, so I uploaded it to Youtube instead ([https://youtu.be/T22DBzdzDK8](https://youtu.be/T22DBzdzDK8)).

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional information, I have checked the non-powered end of the LED strip with a multimeter to confirm that it is receiving a stable 12v through the power.  I don't have an oscilloscope to monitor the data line very well, which is why I resorted to Serial output to monitor where I am in the loop for debugging.  I don't have a capacitor between the power supply and the actual LED strip as is best practice because I was unable to find a capacitor and am waiting for one in the mail.  I do have a 330 ohm resistor on the data line.  The code itself is extremely basic so I am coming to a loss about the consistency issues, any advice on how to proceed with debugging the consistency issues would be greatly appreciated.  If anyone can spot the RGB issue please let me know as well but that is a low-priority item for me currently.

arduino,A little help with an Input Viewer?,"I bought this gamecube input viewer from the website, https://inputviewer.com/products/gamecube-input-viewer. I opened it up and it seems to be an arduino uno that splits a gamecube extension cable. The wire the plugs to the pc connects to a program called ""nintendospy"" that shows the inputs on the controller while you play on the console. 
Here's the problem, I have my own setup for controller viewing and don't want to use the Nintendospy system. The one I'm using just requires the arduino to register as a controller rather as a serial port. I'm a pretty technical guy but converting a serial device to an hid device has proven difficult. Honestly I'd be willing to even hire someone for this, I'm just having such a hard time even figuring out how to hire someone for it.

Hey everyone! I am building an automated watering system for my garden, and I am using a soil moisture sensor, a relay, a water/rain sensor, and an RTC. I have not created the code yet, but I plan on something like this:

 

Prototype Code Example:

A = Moisture sensor (\[+ = Sufficient water moisture\] and \[- = Insufficient water moisture\])

B = Rain Sensor (\[+ = Rain\] and \[- = No rain)

{Code should be clock automated, and attempt to water plants every other day}

* If: B is - and A is -, water plants until A reaches +
* If: B is +, set A to + until B is -, then set A to -, allowing watering until sufficient moisture

Arduino should check on a timed basis whether or not it should water to desired moisture level, and if rain sensor detects moisture, it will wait until rain stops, and then water to desired moisture. If water is already at desired moisture, then it will not water the garden.

&amp;#x200B;

arduino,DIY wireless replacement for usb serial communication,"Hi guys, 
at work I have a testing device connected to my laptop via usb cable. It is recognized as serial device and the software is communicating using the software serial port.

The cable is very annoying but the testing device doesn’t have a wireless option and there are no real alternatives to buy since they’re very expensive.

So I was asking myself if it would be possible to create a „cable replacement“ using Arduino. 
My idea was like that I connect Arduino boards to both laptop and testing device. Both arduinos are mocking the connected device so they think they’re connected to each other and will communicate using serial but wirelessly.

Is this even possible? I couldn’t find similar projects on the internet so I though I ask this sub.

arduino,Connect Arduino to Tuya IoT Cloud,"# Background

Tuya has published its official Arduino library. Arduino boards can work with Tuya’s general Wi-Fi module to connect your prototype to the Tuya IoT Cloud easily. We have reconstructed the library and it is now perfectly compatible with Arduino. You can directly install the library on Arduino IDE without porting the SDK. This can help you get started with a project easily.

## Preparation

* You have installed Arduino IDE on your computer.
* You have got the following stuff.
   * Tuya Sandwich Wi-Fi communication board or Tuya Wi-Fi general module.  


https://preview.redd.it/6u6wqg3y1r971.png?width=393&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b68371a981cad2bb8638c0f4110fb32d3f298f9

* Any board that supports Arduino library, such as ST Nucleo and Arduino UNO.  


https://preview.redd.it/mhqkfzg12r971.png?width=410&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d13fe2ffa8aee5932054aff759ccc8b49cf6d3d

https://preview.redd.it/srvdtd842r971.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=956d28dd856c2382360dc44d63da41d65b65b77e

* You have installed Tuya Smart app on your phone. Download the Tuya Smart app from Apple Store or mobile app stores.

## How it works

The Arduino board communicates with Tuya’s module that is flashed with general firmware through serial communication. Tuya’s module can send device data to the cloud and receive commands from the cloud. The Tuya Smart app can pair with the device and connect it to the Tuya IoT Cloud. Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK  
 library encapsulates Tuya’s serial protocol, which saves your effort to fully understand every detail of the logic behind it. 

https://preview.redd.it/xkh1yxif2r971.png?width=326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f84f8b524ac596b8fbc0e5f4720e8c57879970a

## Run examples

Before development, you can run an example to grasp the application logic.

### Step 1: Install library

Two approaches available

* Open Arduino IDE and click the **Sketch** menu and then **Include Library** \&gt; **Manage Libraries**. Find Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK  
 and install.
* Download the Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK library package. Unzip it and copy all of these files to the **libraries** folder inside your sketchbook. To find the location of your sketchbook folder, go to the top menu in Arduino IDE:   
Windows: File &gt; Preferences.   
macOS: Arduino &gt; Preferences.

Restart Arduino IDE and verify that Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK  
 appears in the **Sketch** \&gt; **Include Library**\&gt; **Contributed libraries**.  


https://preview.redd.it/mr01kxli2r971.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699ac4716d38b37b3dbf8613c18cb72ef7dd8cf2

### Step 2: Select an example

Our library provides several examples to help you get on board easily.

* Start  
: a basic example that contains a switch data point (DP). You can turn on or off the light with a mobile app.
* DataPointType  
: an example to report DP data to the cloud and receive commands from the cloud. Six data types are supported.
* SHT30  
: an example of a peripheral.  


https://preview.redd.it/zv425nnp2r971.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67948d97c75079c3fcf149e4b8f9f4c14256e20f

### Step 3: Compile and upload code

After you finish writing the sketch, use the verifying tool to check for errors and compile code. Before uploading, go to **Tools** \&gt; **Port**, and select the board that is connected to your computer. Then, you are good to upload the code to the board.

&gt;**Note**: Pins 0 and 1 on Arduino are used for communication with Tuya’s board. Before uploading, you need to disconnect Tuya’s board from the Arduino board, or press and hold the reset button on Tuya’s board. The connection between these two boards might interfere with the uploading.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0tcmjb0t2r971.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe3730cbce2d5ad548b50a8529094c0c57342df5

### Step 4: Pair device

When Pin 7 (key pin) on the Arduino is pulled low, the board will send a pairing command to Tuya’s module. When the module receives this command, the onboard LED\_BUILTIN  
 will flicker, indicating that the module enters the pairing mode. Then, use the Tuya Smart app to pair with the module and test the data communication with the cloud.  
The image below shows the control panel of a connected device. We use DataPointType  
 as the example and select a debugging panel on the Tuya IoT Platform.

arduino,Question about USBASP and 10 pin to 6 pin adapter,"Had to get a new USBASP as the old one bricked itself somehow. It responds but can't ""find"" Arduino when it's plugged in the ISP header.  I considered reflashing it to be sure but the download I found are full of files that made no sense to me and the manual AVRDude programming instruction didn't work for me, I guess I was looking at wrong host computer? (ie instruction for Linux not for Windows)

I got a cheap USBASP because $3 was cheap rather than trying to make reflashing work.  However it's a 10 pin USBASP, for some reason when I was looking, all the 6 pins programmers were $8 and up, more than if I made a quick 10 to 6 pin adapter to go with $3 USBASP.

Standard pinout shows pin 4, 6, 8, and 10 are all connected to ground. But when I looked at my new USBASP to verify pinout, 4 and 6 were labeled TX and RX and goes to ATMega8 pin 31 and 30, through 200 ohms resistor.  That seemed nonstandard to me, and 200 ohms seem like a weak short circuit protection if the chip tries to pull up TX pin.  Can I just evict the 2 resistors to disable 2 ways serial communication and wire the adapter properly with all 4 grounded pins?

PS just in case, is there a Windows 10 how to guide for reflashing USBISP? If I can make it work, I'd have an extra."

And I send the character to the arduino via bluetooth from my phone. The arduino makes the pattern but it doesn't loop it, but if I make it so that it loops the arduino doesn't detect the new character that I send to the arduino, so it gets stuck on the pattern that I first sent to it.

I want to be able to schedule automatic alarm activation/deactivation times via my web GUI. My GUI collects the hour, minute and AM/PM designation for when I'd like the alarm to switch between active and inactive. For example, the start time might be 9:00PM and the end time is 6:00AM.

I use the [ezTime](https://github.com/ropg/ezTime) library to poll NTP servers, manipulate time variables and schedule events. ezTime requires the hour, minute, second, day, month and year when creating a scheduled event.

The challenge arises when one begins to consider the start time could be tomorrow - and what if today is is the last day of the month/year? Creating calendar logic seems wrong. I'm starting to think the process should work something like this:

1. Ignore the current date for now. Get the current time in 24-hour format.
2. Convert my schedule time to 24-hour format.
3. If the current time is later than the schedule time, subtract schedule time from current time (subtracting hours and minutes separately). Otherwise, subtract the current time from the schedule time.
4. Convert the resultant hours and minutes to seconds.
5. Add the seconds to the current epoch time.
6. Convert the resultant epoch time back into a date/time object using the ezTime library and use that to schedule the event.

But even this seems terribly difficult. I've searched for other solutions to no avail. If anyone has any other advice or can reassure me that this is a good method, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you!"

arduino,Connect Arduino to Tuya IoT Cloud,"# 

This topic describes how to install the Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK  
 library on Arduino IDE and connect a device to the Tuya IoT Cloud.

## Background

Tuya has published its official Arduino library. Arduino boards can work with Tuya’s general Wi-Fi module to connect your prototype to the Tuya IoT Cloud easily. We have reconstructed the library and it is now perfectly compatible with Arduino. You can directly install the library on Arduino IDE without porting the SDK. This can help you get started with a project easily.

## Preparation

·  You have installed Arduino IDE on your computer.

·  You have got the following stuff.

o Tuya Sandwich Wi-Fi communication board or Tuya Wi-Fi general module.  


o Any board that supports Arduino library, such as ST Nucleo and Arduino UNO.  


·  You have installed Tuya Smart app on your phone. Download the Tuya Smart app from Apple Store or mobile app stores.

## How it works

The Arduino board communicates with Tuya’s module that is flashed with general firmware through serial communication. Tuya’s module can send device data to the cloud and receive commands from the cloud. The Tuya Smart app can pair with the device and connect it to the Tuya IoT Cloud. Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK  
 library encapsulates Tuya’s serial protocol, which saves your effort to fully understand every detail of the logic behind it. 📷

## Run examples

Before development, you can run an example to grasp the application logic.

### Step 1: Install library

Two approaches available

·  Open Arduino IDE and click the **Sketch** menu and then **Include Library** \&gt; **Manage Libraries**. Find Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK  
 and install.

·  Download the Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK library package. Unzip it and copy all of these files to the **libraries** folder inside your sketchbook. To find the location of your sketchbook folder, go to the top menu in Arduino IDE:   
Windows: File &gt; Preferences.   
macOS: Arduino &gt; Preferences.

Restart Arduino IDE and verify that Tuya\_WiFi\_MCU\_SDK  
 appears in the **Sketch** \&gt; **Include Library**\&gt; **Contributed libraries**.  


### Step 2: Select an example

Our library provides several examples to help you get on board easily.

·  Start  
: a basic example that contains a switch data point (DP). You can turn on or off the light with a mobile app.

·  DataPointType  
: an example to report DP data to the cloud and receive commands from the cloud. Six data types are supported.

·  SHT30  
: an example of a peripheral.  


### Step 3: Compile and upload code

After you finish writing the sketch, use the verifying tool to check for errors and compile code. Before uploading, go to **Tools** \&gt; **Port**, and select the board that is connected to your computer. Then, you are good to upload the code to the board.

**Note**: Pins 0 and 1 on Arduino are used for communication with Tuya’s board. Before uploading, you need to disconnect Tuya’s board from the Arduino board, or press and hold the reset button on Tuya’s board. The connection between these two boards might interfere with the uploading.

### Step 4: Pair device

When Pin 7 (key pin) on the Arduino is pulled low, the board will send a pairing command to Tuya’s module. When the module receives this command, the onboard LED\_BUILTIN  
 will flicker, indicating that the module enters the pairing mode. Then, use the Tuya Smart app to pair with the module and test the data communication with the cloud.  
The image below shows the control panel of a connected device. We use DataPointType  
 as the example and select a debugging panel on the Tuya IoT Platform.

arduino,"Before I start getting more into it, is this a feasible project?","I’m trying to take one of those robotic vacuums and turn it into a virtual presence type device that can be controlled over the internet. I don’t have much experience with electronics or programming, so I thought I’d ask here before getting into it more. So Basically the story is, I live far from my family and I’d love to have a little robot there that would be me. Lol. I’d take a roomba, gut all the cleaning parts out of it, make it controllable over the internet using it’s motors and wheels, then fit one of those 360 two way Audio ip cameras on top, and have it all powered by the vacuum’s built in battery. I want to use a vacuum, because of the charging port they have, I could just drive myself into the charging port and recharge. This all would have to be controlled over a separate internet hundreds of miles away and while it’s no problem for the camera, I’m not sure about controlling the vacuum itself. Sorry if this sounds ridiculous and far fetched, but is a project like this plausible? Any thoughts? Thanks."

arduino,Help choosing a TFT Display with the right connection and driver,"Arduino almost-noob here. I want a 4.3"" TFT display for my steering wheel (non-touch), but I am very intimidated by the different types, different connections etc that are out there. I just want to avoid spending 50 bucks on something and wait 3 weeks only to find out it doesn't even plug in. I will be controlling the screen with an ESP32 (to get UDP data from the game to the screen), and my main questions are:

1. I'm not sure how to know if the display will be easily connectable to the ESP32. I have seen that there are many different connection types, and I think UART or SPI or I2C is what I want (?) but a lot of screens seem to have the RGB connection, 8-bit, 16-bit, or some other connection with like 40 pins that I don't want to have to deal with. I've seen tutorials and such where the person just connects the TX, RX, 3.3V and ground (this is UART?), or uses the Master and Slave connections (this is I2C? and who the fuck named that) instead of using the massive FFC or FPC or whatever it is. The screen is for car telemetry so it's just basic numbers, text, colors etc. Not going to be playing any movies through the thing. 
2. How do I know if the display will be controllable from the ESP32, and how do I know which library to use?

arduino,Sparkfun Wav Trigger with arduino,"Hi again,

I have a project the should play up to 16 audio files simultaneously (polyphony)

I understand the sparkfun Wav trigger is the most easy way to do so and can function on its own.

Another wish for that project is to be able to control the pitch of each individual track with a potentiometer. Is it something possible? perhaps  I need to use Arduino for that matter?

It seems the sparkdun 'Wav Trigger' have only digital input (the 16 trigger inputs). In the overview it was written that it is possible to control the pitch. I wander how so if I don't see any analog input?

Another issue is that they write that the 'Wav Trigger' can play 32 mono files but there is only 16 trigger inputs. Is it possible to expand the trigger inputs?

Any idea?

It is probably how I have structured the code, but again, I am not sure as I am so new to C++ and coding in general.

Here is a picture of my connections, am I right in having my ground pins from the sensors connected to the normally closed pins on the relay, and the VCC pins from the sensors connected to the common pins on the relay?

If anyone is able to help me code this correctly, to the correct hardware pins with the relay and produce the timed events required, I would be eternally grateful!!!!

Is anyone able to help me out? I know this code is also messy (well, looks like it to me) so any advice on clearer structure of code would be amazing too!

arduino,Question about powering my project,"I want to use a 16-channel relay module (may want a second or third module in the future) to turn on or off heating elements made with some Kanthal. I’d like to be able to turn on/off several or maybe all relays at once. Was thinking of using a Lipo battery to power this, and an Arduino mega to control it. Would I need to limit the current on this battery? Should I get a different battery? Should I regulate the amps somehow, and maybe with an automotive fuse? How do I know how many amps I need if I wanted all 16-48 relays going off at the same time and the kanthal to get real hot quickly?

arduino,Arduino Keyboard library not working anymore,"My Arduino MK1000 was working fine with the Keyboard.h library.  [Keyboard.press](https://Keyboard.press)() was working fine for any key, and everything seemed fine. 

Until that cursed day, where I casually connected the arduino for yet another project, and suddenly the Keyboard was not working! I checked to see if this was perhaps a code issue but I tried with the simplest code, but it still not working

    #include &lt;Keyboard.h&gt;
    
    void setup() {
      pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);
      Serial.begin(9600);
      Keyboard.begin();
    }
    
    void loop() {
      //if the button is pressed
      if (digitalRead(2) == LOW) {
        Keyboard.press('v');
        Serial.println(""checking"");
      }
    }

&amp;#x200B;

The serial command do run, so the software recognize the press of the button, but it doesn't operate as expected with the Keyboard. I tried reinstalling the lib, I tried desktop IDE and online editor, I tried different keyboard command (press, print, write) but none seems to work. 

I thought it might be something to do with the computer so I REINSTALLED windows (I don't believe I did that) but the error still persistence. 

As a last resort, I humbly stand before you, asking for your guidance.. 

Thank you for your time"

arduino,Custom WS2812 R1 RN19 Angel Eyes,"Hi Everyone so i made these Headlights im very proud of and wanted to show you my results:

I learned a lot on my way building these :).

\- Custom PCB built and milled by myself (build a CNC milling machine to create my own pcb)

\- 3D modeled the ring holder on a way that i can always replace them if 1 gets faulty

\- Learned a lot about Fastled library and coding in general (no coding experience before)

&amp;#x200B;

The starting sequence is from purple to white with a light dimming (color combination of my bike is black and purple). This is the normal driving mode. I also made some show modes wich are indicated by the red LED over the dashboard (so i dont forget to turn it off when i´m driving again

&amp;#x200B;

The Rings and Eyes are controlled by an Arduino Nano wich i will mount behind the Dashboard.

The only concern i have is if i turn the normal lights on maybe it will get to hot and melt the plastic but i will see (mainly driving in daytime).

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to ask me questions.

3. Sending drone b to some random point in a 50 meter radius from drone a.

1. I want these drones to be as small as possible. Maximum size is fitting in the palm of your hand.
2. I want them to be no more than 50 meters apart and able to detect distance from each other a meter away or greater.
3. I'm not sure gps will be actuate enough to detect different locations of a meter apart. If yes, please link to one that could. Could some sort of ping system work to determine distance and direction?"
arduino,"Power supply requirements for powering Arduino UNO, 4DC motors, and one stepper motor.","I have a proyect based on an Arduino UNO which requires the following:

* 1 x Color sensor (TCS34725)
* 1 x 1602 LCD display through an I2C backpack
* 1 x Servomotor (SG90)
* 1 x Stepper motor (28BYJ-48 5v + ULN2003 driver)
* 1 x Rotary encoder (KY-040)
* 4 x DC motors (unknown everything, pulled from random joysticks, work at 3-5v)

Besides the 4 DC motors (due to not actually testing them), everything works fine. But I've noticed flickering on the display only when the stepper motor is active. I'm guessing it's something to do with it's current draw during operation. I was already planning on powering the 4 DC motors externally, using the same power supply (12v-2A) that I would use with the Arduino and controlling their state with a 5v relay. The Arduino and the relay-motors circuits would be wired in parallel, so they would both have 12v, but the DC motors would be in series with each other, splitting the voltage so that each get 3v. Now that I have to add another component which seems to require 5v, I'm losing confidence that I can do it with the same power supply.

So here goes the question, what power supply would I need to power this entire thing? In the first place, can it be done with just one?

arduino,Starting an Arduino Boot Camp!!,"Hey Guys!

So I am going to be starting an Arduino Boot Camp, where I teach the basics for using/programming an Arduino. In the lessons, I will guide you through interfacing with a variety of components with the Arduino. Here is a detailed ""agenda"" of what I will be covering:

* Digital Logic (LEDs, Multiplexing, ICs, Rotary Encoders, etc)
* Analog Logic (Photoresistors, Potentiometers, Hall sensors, etc)
* PWM (Servos and ESCs + detailed applications)
* Motor Control and standards (DC, BLDC, ESCs)
* IC Design (basics)
* More Complex Circuit Design (amplifiers, filters, etc)
* LCD control (I2C)
* RFID Tag readers
* Wireless and Serial Communication Basics + Examples
* Interrupts

I believe these are the fundamentals that take the longest to learn by yourself and would greatly benefit from this information being taught with a curriculum.  After these lessons, it should be fairly easy for anyone to learn at a faster rate since they have strong foundational knowledge.

**Credentials:**

I am a third-year Electrical Engineering Major, Minoring in Computer Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I am part of the Honors College and taught myself the basics of Arduino in High School over the course of multiple years. The classes I have taken in University, my own knowledge from learning Arduino, and my experience as a Curriculum Developer for Jersey Stem make me a great candidate to teach Arduino. I have taught multiple intro to programming classes in the past, and I want to take it a step further and teach something that is more hands-on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pricing:**

I have a 10-hour curriculum that will cover all these concepts and it includes hands-on examples for each one. The rate will be $45 an hour, and it is based on hours taught and not a package for 10 hours. If you have a specific concept you want to go over, I can do that as well, it doesn't have to be related to the curriculum. If you feel like the class was poorly taught or you did not learn as much as expected I will guarantee a refund. If you do pay for hours in bulk, I will offer a discount of:

* 10% for 5 hours upfront.
* 20% for 10 hours upfront.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mode:**

I will be teaching this course live, online, in a one-on-one session.  I will share my screen so you can see what I am doing, and have my video on my board so you can also see the circuit clearly. It is recommended that you have a starter kit with the following items shown below to absorb the most information since passive learning isn't the point of this series.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kit (I am not selling):**

* 1x Arduino Uno (2 for Arduino-Arduino interface example)
* 2x PWM 5g Servo Motors
* 1x DC Motor
* 50x single-color LEDs
* Assorted Resistor Set (1ohm - 100kOhm min)
* Assorted Diode Set
* Assorted Capacitor Set (Electrolytic and Ceramic)
* LCD Display with backpack (I2C)
* Rotary Encoder
* Potentiometers
* Jumper Wire Set
* BreadBoards
* Photoresistors
* any other sensor you want to go over!!

&amp;#x200B;

**Age Groups:**

This is open to all students age 13+. I have a lot of experience teaching both kids and adults!

&amp;#x200B;

**Contact:**

You can contact me over email if you are interested or have any questions.

arduino,"Is it possible to have a micro/leonardo/etc receive a string from an rPi over GPIO, and then send that string as keystrokes to another devices over USB HID KB emulation?","I guess this is a combination HW/SW question. 

I've been googling around a bit, and everything I see about connection rPi and Arduino uses USB serial. From what I understand there is a secondary serial interface on the GPIO that should work? 

If so, is it possible to send a string over that connection which is then translated into keystrokes on a device the Arduino is plugged into (acting as HID keyboard)?

My end goal is to do this using node-RED on the Pi. 

Are there any flaws anyone sees in this idea that would stop it dead in its tracks?"
arduino,Rastar Shelby GT500 - Arduino + NRF24L01,"just wanted to share my first year EE project that I did last year.

arduino,"Struggling to find ""useful"" projects","Used to love arduino, but took a break with it cause of college. Trying to get back into it, but all the projects seem useless? I don't like LEDs or home automation. I don't see the purpose in making self balancing robots, robots that avoid obstacles, or barometers or stuff like that. I understand that you gain knowledge from trying, failing, and ultimately suceeding in making these things. But at the end of the day the actual THING you're left with is just a toy. I love problem solving, and the process of figuring out how all the components work and how they go together was what got me into this. But now I feel like there is nothing that I could make that would truly make a diference in my day to day life. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is there a project that will result in a useful, functional thing? Something that only arduino can do?"

arduino,playing audio samples simultaneously - what option do I have,"Hello,

I would like to build a machine with around 20 - 25 bottoms. Each bottom will control one audio sample/file. When pressing one bottom it will play the audio sample from beginning to end. same will happen when pressing any of the bottoms but with a different audio files. I need to have the option to play few audio samples simultaneously. So if I am pressing bottom one then another one and another one I will hear all audio samples in polyphony. the output should be connected to 3 to 5 headphones/speakers. Is it possible? 

Until now I use a card reader(DF player mini) in order to play one audio sample at a time. What are my option in order to have the ability to play around 10 files at the same time?

arduino,Pointers vs. iterating through arrays?,"I'm new to C++ and don't really understand pointers. I'm learning to use fixed-length character arrays instead of strings (this *is* more efficient, right? No dynamic arrays = more better?) but when performing actions like sending serial data, I just iterate through the array instead of using pointers.   


I imagine this is worse, because none of the example code does it.

arduino,Button pins trigger upon touching them,"Three pins on my board are set to INPUT\_PULLUP. Later I'm going to connect them to GND through buttons to trigger necessary effects upon pressing a button. They sort of work, but whenever I touch any of these pins (or the wires soldered to them) with a finger or tweezers, the pin triggers as if being connected to GND. It cripples my project, so I have to fight it.

What's the reason for that? My body capacitance? Induction? How can I neutralize this effect? I haven't tried using actual buttons yet, I just shorted the wires to test how the project will react.

More than that, touching bare contact isn't necessary – pins trigger even if I hold the wire by its insulation (I don't think it matters, but I'll mention that my wires are silicon-insulated). If I touch a pin with the tweezers with insulated handles, pins trigger too."

arduino,Looking for EU based eBay alternative for components etc.,"tl;dr: **Anyone know of a good website for inexpensive Arduino boards and modules, motors, components etc. in the EU?**  


I have historically bought a lot of components  and arduino (modules) off of eBay, since the pricing in my country - Denmark - can be crazy (F.ex MPU6050 breakout board costs $22 - $58, while it costs less than $3 on eBay), same goes for most if not all other modules and components, plus the availability is poor on a lot of things.  


This has especially made sense since we up until recently have had an exception where items valued at $12.77 or less was exempt from import customs fees and VAT, but since this has been removed it no longer does.  


Don't get me wrong, i wouldn't mind paying vat and customs, for example 40% on top of aforementioned $3 is still way cheaper than $22 + $5-6 in shipping, the problem is that customs charge a flat fee of  $25.5 to process customs, meaning that **any item no matter the value, ordered from outside of the EU, will have at least $25.5 added to the price...**  


So, apart from larger purchases which i rarely make, ordering stuff outside of the EU no longer makes sense to me, so I am looking for an alternate source of various arduino related boards, as well as basic components, motors, servos etc.   


Anyone have some good EU sources? :)"

arduino,Solenoid valve - How does it work? [album in post],"First off, my question is technically related to *fluid dynamics*, but is a part of an arduino irrigation system project. This might be too off topic, so let me know if I should delete it (and which sub is more suitable)!

I bought a solenoid valve [and opened it up to figure out how it works.](https://imgur.com/a/47J0QmO) I've tried to [draw a cross-section of the valve](https://imgur.com/a/vM2FbN5) to help explain my question: 

The spring pushing on the iron rod keeps the input and output chambers sealed off, and switching *on* the solenoid pulls the rod up allowing water to flow. BUT why is there two holes in the sealing? The tiny hole off-center is used to keep the second spring in place, but water may still flow through the gaps from the input chamber to *the chamber of secrets*. The center hole between *the chamber of secrets* and the output chamber is sealed by the rubber tip on the iron rod. Is all of this by design? Is the off-center hole necessary in order to get the same pressure in both the input chamber and *chamber of secrets* (reducing the required force to be applied by the iron rod), and not the entire input pressure pushing the sealing upwards?

Would it be possible to drop the holes and simply use the solenoid to push the ""solid"" sealing down on the output opening?"

The strip is WS2812B, I've asked my brother to solder the connections because he has experience in this and so far, nothing is working...

I've had a power supply, I assumed it was faulty, turns out when I bought another one, the problem isn't gone! I got a MeanWell RS-35-5 which outputs up to 7A, but that shouldn't be an issue since my test strip has only about 16 LEDs. My strip has been cut to some other pieces and none of them work, so I assume the strip isn't the problem. I just purchased the MeanWell PSU and set it up to no avail.

I'm using 2 Arduino Unos. One is real and another is a fake one, both show the same problem. I connected the LED strip to the connector, it lights up slightly (I can see the RGB LEDs individually like little dots, and then they fade out.

I've tried different Arduinos, different pins, I have completely redone this wiring from the beginning to make sure something wasn't soldered correctly, different power supplies, and nothing works. At this point I have no idea what to do. I've tested the strip with a multimeter and it shows it's getting 5V.

arduino,Help for a newbie please!,"Hi there! I’m planning on creating an animatronic/robot of [Wheatley from Portal 2](https://images.app.goo.gl/JKZ4qht9eDaciJwZA) with sound files from the game and voice recognition to give commands that he will respond to. 

I have ~10 years hobby-based experience in coding Visual Basic in advanced Excel and Access projects, and some experience in video game design and animation, and a lot of experience in 3D design and 3D printing. But I’ve never made any coded projects in the real world, only digital. 

I’m just wondering where to even begin? I saw a website where someone used an Arduino Uno however their Wheatley was animated real-time with a PS3 controller providing input. I want to store “animations” and have them play alongside sound files when given a certain command. 

A couple of things I envision it doing:

* when it turns on it will immediately run a wake-up program with a sound and series of movements, and then go into idle state

* idle state continues indefinitely and is interruptible by a wake word and/or voice command

* a voice command will be something like “Wheatley say hello” and he will then pick one sound and movement set from a range, like for example I have five clips of him saying hello and I would like him to play a different one each time. They can happen one at a time in order or pick a random one, I’m not fussed really

* when given a command and giving an output of movement and sound, this is uninterruptible so voice recognition should turn off briefly

* I have a maximum of around ten commands that I want to be able to say, some with only one output, some with multiple possible outputs where one will be chosen (as above, with “say hello”)

* perhaps after a certain amount of time in “idle” he will speak of his own accord

* in an ideal world it would have other inputs too, like a light sensor where he comments if it gets too dark, and accelerometer that detects when he’s falling and yells out, and then when falling he detects when he stops falling and says “ow”. I understand I may be making this even more complicated though, so prepared to scrap these

I am really excited about this project and eager to start but not really sure *where* to start. I’m confident in my existing knowledge and my ability to learn quickly. One thing I will say is I am autistic and really struggle with instructional videos, I prefer to read and follow with pictures. So if you’re going to link anything I would really prefer it in that format please but if necessary I can watch videos. 

Thank you for any help you can provide!"

I have two, identical NEMA 34 stepper motors. One of the works great, the other doesn’t make any noise or move at all when wired in the exact same way as the working one. 

One important difference I’ve recognised is that when both are powered off, the axle of the functional motor turns by hand a more difficultly, with more rigid, step-like movements. The non-functional motor turns freely without resistance like a normal shaft with bearings.

The stepper motors are older models lended to me by my university for my honours project. I cannot find any replacements online or any spec/data sheets for them. I have 3D printed stepper motor mounts that are only suitable for these motors and not other NEMA 34 motors. I am running out of time and I really need this motor to work.

I have dismantled the motor to look for obvious damage or issues but nothing seems out of the ordinary.

arduino,Noob question: Powering external device from Arduino,"Hi everyone! Thanks to corona, I have started playing around with some kinds of micro controllers, but, was not dealing with electronics in the past xxx years :)

My idea was to control Air Freshener device, which is powered by a single AA 1.5V battery. (If I remember correctly, it was consuming around 1mAh when motor was triggered, but might be wrong). It has On/Off and is being activated too frequently (like every 1-5minutes) which is a waste of air fresheners. And as I cannot tweak much on this device itself, I thought I would be able to control it with external device, like Arduino Nano / atmel328p.

The problem however is that those devices have  5V and 3.3V outputs. This is likely too much to power air freshener, so I tried to lower the voltage using various resistors, was able to get 1.5V, but the device seems to ignore this completely, and is not being activated by said voltage.

My other idea was to keep the original power (AA battery), but to control the circuit with a relay. I haven't tried this yet, as I thought that one power source of Arduino, should be fine for the external device itself.

I feel like I'm missing something simple here, but cannot understand what exactly. Output voltage on pins was okayish, but it doesn't make the device work.

Would appreciate any hints on how to properly connect board pins to power external device. Thanks!

P.S. When experimenting with just breadboard power supply module (In 9V, out 3.3V/5V), I was able to activate air freshener with 3.3V output, but the same 3.3V produced from the Arduino pins have no effect."

arduino,Programming a robotic arm to write?,"I guess this is both hardware help and software help! I was wondering is it would be possible to program a simple robotic arm to write using a pen attachment. How small of a font could I potentially do? 
There are a lot of short stories that I love and it would be great to write them out on good quality paper and bind them together beautifully, and the little imperfections that you’d get not using a printer + the machine running in the background almost as an art piece, slowly writing away, both really appeal to me. 

I’ve have a little bit of experience with coding arduinos, but definitely not very much more than connecting an LED to a motion sensor. So I’m not entirely fresh but am very, very much a novice in this space. Thanks very much for any info!"
arduino,How are bytes sent to a peripheral in the Arduino BLE library?,"I'm trying to use a Javascript BLE library to send and read data from an Arduino Nano IoT. I can read from the BLEIntCharacteristic  just fine but I can't write to it. This is de the data I'm sending: 

 

`//Write data to BLE device`  
`document.getElementById(""btnWrite"").onclick = async function () {`  
 `console.log(""Writing data: "" + iptWaarde.value);`  
 `await schrijfKar.writeValueWithoutResponse(new Uint8Array([0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff]));`  
`}`  
After reading from the nano the value is still set to the initial value (12345). 

I have looked at the implementation on Github of writeValue to look if I  need to include a checksum or something but I haven't found anything yet. 

Here's the implementation of writeValue: [https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/blob/master/src/remote/BLERemoteCharacteristic.cpp](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/blob/master/src/remote/BLERemoteCharacteristic.cpp)

`int BLERemoteCharacteristic::writeValue(const uint8_t value[], int length, bool withResponse)`  
In this function they use:     ATT.writeCmd(\_connectionHandle, \_valueHandle, value, length); for writing without a response. 

The implementation of that is available here: [https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/blob/master/src/utility/ATT.cpp](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/blob/master/src/utility/ATT.cpp)

`int ATTClass::sendReq(uint16_t connectionHandle, void* requestBuffer, int requestLength, uint8_t responseBuffer[])`

I could keep digging but I don't see anything close to a checksum or any bytes that I need to add. Can anyone help explain to me with I'm not seeing?"

arduino,"Hello, I need some help to make my proyect independent of my computer.","Hello, I already asked for help, and my proyect works just fine, the only problem is that when I tried powering it up by conecting it to the wall(through a 5v converter(The one from my phone)) but it stop working. Here is the code:

int i = 0;

int lum = 110;

int sleep = 300;

void setup() {

&amp;#x200B;

  pinMode(A0, INPUT);

  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);

&amp;#x200B;

  digitalWrite(8, 1);

&amp;#x200B;

}

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

void loop() {

  int micro = analogRead(0);

  if (micro&gt;95 and i == 0)

  {

digitalWrite(8, 0);

i = 1;  

delay(200);

  }

  micro = analogRead(0);

  if (micro&gt;95 and i == 1)

  {

digitalWrite(8, 1);

i = 0;

delay(200);

&amp;#x200B;

   }

 }

&amp;#x200B;

What the program does is simple, it turns on and off a LED through a Relay when a mic detects I clap. The proyect works just fine coneccted to my computer, but when I plug it to the wall with my phone charger it doesnt work. Once I clap the light just turns of after 200 miliseconds. 

What I dont understand is why the proyect works diferently if both sources of energy(my computer &amp; phone charger)  give the proyecto the same amount of energy.

arduino,Is it possible to charge two 18650 batteries in series?,"I found the TP4056 board which allows you to charge one 18650 battery (or perhaps 2 in parallel), but didn't find anything to charge 2 in series, which perhaps is just not physically possible to evenly charge both batteries in a series configuration.

What I ultimately want to accomplish is that I have an Arduino Uno in an enclosure box powered by two 18650 batteries in series.  Currently I have to open the enclosure, remove the batteries, and place them in a USB battery charger.  If there were someway to plug in my box to an outlet (or perhaps solar panel) to charge the batteries in place without having to remove them that would be great."

arduino,I making my first PCB with my arduino - what trace widths and spacing should I use?,"I'm using a lipo battery with a booster to get it to 5V, and a bunch shift registers, a tonne of push buttons and surface mount LEDs. I have never made a PCB before, so I don't know the standards for the trace widths, and research has showed me that the width you use depends on the amount of current going through the circuit and other things. For the sake of simplicity, what trace width and spacing would you recommend for what I am doing here?

Thanks."
arduino,Output to UART and SD when Available,"Hi, I'm have a sketch working that prints data to both an SD card and a UART port at the same time using print the statements but when the SD isn't available it crashes. I don't quite understand how the set up statements all work and so I'm having trouble coming up with a way to ""redo"" the print setup accordingly. 

I tried to re-do the commands for the setup if the SDcard isn't available but that doesnt' seem to work, i'm guessing that is a scope problem? Any thoughts?

Should I just solder every pin of the arduino on different holes in the board?

I am using development kit iot from dragino ( arduino uno with lora shield and single channel gateway Lg01 ) and lmic library.

I have a doubt how can I make a lora shield from Dragino to send packets in a single frequency 868.1 Mhz and SF7 to enable the gateway to receive these packets since gateway works only a single channel. I am not willing to connect Lg01 with ttn. Cuz SCGs distirb Lorawan network ? Any ideas ?
 I downloaded a lmic-master  library from dragino, but doesn't work. Lora shield sends packets in differernt frequencies ( maybe hopping freqs ?!)
I selected the frequency band to match my shiled region in the lmic config file. And there is also file called lora.base shall i modified something as well? 

here I attcahed pic from serial monitor. the device tries to join network

arduino,How do I change I2C address of Atlas Scientific EZO pump with Feather Huzzah?,"I have a Wifi hydroponics kit from Atlas Scientific, and a number of EZO dosing pumps I want to control with it. The hydro kit uses a Feather Huzzah as the brains of the operation. The dosing pumps come pre set with an I2C address of 103 (0x67).

&amp;#x200B;

[https://atlas-scientific.com/kits/wi-fi-hydroponics-kit/](https://atlas-scientific.com/kits/wi-fi-hydroponics-kit/)

[https://atlas-scientific.com/peristaltic/ezo-pmp/](https://atlas-scientific.com/peristaltic/ezo-pmp/)

&amp;#x200B;

Given that I want to control multiple pumps, I need to re-address some of them, but have had no luck so far achieving this.

&amp;#x200B;

With one pump connected to the Huzzah's SDA/SCL, I am able to use the below I2C scanner code to successfully scan for and find it on the 103 address.

`#include &lt;Wire.h&gt; //include Wire.h library`

&amp;#x200B;

`void setup()`

`{`

  `Wire.begin(); // Wire communication begin`

  `Serial.begin(9600); // The baudrate of Serial monitor is set in 9600`

  `while (!Serial); // Waiting for Serial Monitor`

  `Serial.println(""\nI2C Scanner"");`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

`void loop()`

`{`

  `byte error, address; //variable for error and I2C address`

  `int nDevices;`

&amp;#x200B;

  `Serial.println(""Scanning..."");`

&amp;#x200B;

  `nDevices = 0;`

  `for (address = 1; address &lt; 127; address++ )`

  `{`

`// The i2c_scanner uses the return value of`

`// the Write.endTransmisstion to see if`

`// a device did acknowledge to the address.`

`Wire.beginTransmission(address);`

`error = Wire.endTransmission();`

&amp;#x200B;

`if (error == 0)`

`{`

`Serial.print(""I2C device found at address 0x"");`

`if (address &lt; 16)`

`Serial.print(""0"");`

`Serial.print(address, HEX);`

`Serial.println(""  !"");`

`nDevices++;`

`}`

`else if (error == 4)`

`{`

`Serial.print(""Unknown error at address 0x"");`

`if (address &lt; 16)`

`Serial.print(""0"");`

`Serial.println(address, HEX);`

`}`

  `}`

  `if (nDevices == 0)`

`Serial.println(""No I2C devices found\n"");`

  `else`

`Serial.println(""done\n"");`

&amp;#x200B;

  `delay(5000); // wait 5 seconds for the next I2C scan`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

The manual ( [https://atlas-scientific.com/files/EZO\_PMP\_Datasheet.pdf](https://atlas-scientific.com/files/EZO_PMP_Datasheet.pdf) , pg. 73) lists commands available, including one to change the I2C address as below.

 I2C, n where n = new address. eg:

I2C,101 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried sending this using the wire library (code below) but with no luck...

&amp;#x200B;

`#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;` 

&amp;#x200B;

`void setup()`

`{`

  `Wire.begin();` 

  `Serial.begin(9600);` 

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

`void loop()`

`{`

  `Wire.beginTransmission(103);`

  `Wire.write(""I2C,104"");`

  `Wire.endTransmission();`

&amp;#x200B;

  `delay(500000);` 

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

The device still appears on 103 when I run the I2C scanner code. Any ideas what I am missing?"

Im hoping someone who's good at this could sort this out in a few mins

arduino,How to control a 10-digit display,"Hello r/arduino,

I've just finished up one of my first projects including a couple of [4-digit 7-segment displays](https://www.adafruit.com/product/865) using Adafruit's I2C backpacks. I've got them on different addresses and everything is going fine, behaving like I want them to.

My next thought was to build a longer display out of a custom number of digits, rather than in blocks of 4. I found [individual digits](https://www.jameco.com/z/QDSP-H449-Hewlett-Packard-LED-Display-7-Segment-Orange-0-56-Inch-Common-Cathode-RHDP-3mcd_2280159.html) easily, but I'm not familiar enough to know how to control them. I found Adafruit's [HT16K33 Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1427) ([Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ht16K33v110.pdf), [Schematic](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/36077)), which says it can control up to 128 individual LEDs. That would be more than enough for 10 7-segment digits, but something's telling me it won't work.

Can anyone explain why I would or wouldn't be able to make a 10-digit display using individual digits controlled through the HT16K33 Breakout?"

I am wanting to pass this information to a strip of 5v rgb lights yet I'm not sure how I would go about getting the array over to an RGB strip. I found some stuff online dating an Arduino would be best for controlling an RGB strip so I thought I'd ask here. Again any help/tips are greatly appreciated as I'm not sure where exactly to start."

arduino,Need help with power distribution and (autonomously) charging of a robot-car,"Hi,

I want to make a small robot on wheels that can dock and wirelessly charge. The question I'm stuck on  is the power distribution between these parts:

\- Microcontroller (likely a DFRobot Beetle BLE)

\- ESC (Brushless Electronic Speed Controller)

\- Lipo battery

\- Lipo charger (on board the robot)

\- Inductive/wireless power element (receiver onboard the robot)

The goal is that the little robot can dock and will automatically start charging. 

From what I can find with google it would seem best to use a power distribution/charger combo board.

Something like this maybe: [https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/toebehoren/batterijen/lipo-rider-plus-charger-booster-5v-usb-c](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/toebehoren/batterijen/lipo-rider-plus-charger-booster-5v-usb-c)

""The 3.3V output is normally on, and the 5V output supports IO control or manual switch, which means you can use 3.3V to supply power for a microcontroller and use the I/O of this microcontroller to control the 5V output, totally programmable.""

In this case the ESC would be connected to the 5V output. It says it's programmable, so would this mean it can detect the input from the wireless charger after docking and automatically start charging?

However with this board I'm also concerned that the ""Up to 5V / 2.4A output current - USB Type A"" isn't enough to attach an ESC to and run the motor with. 

So does anyone maybe know a charging board that can output more Amps to an ESC?

Or should I solve this in a different way? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

arduino,MP3 Library is not recognised,"Hi,

So, I was wishing to download a library for my MP3 module. I did a google search and found that the one I had corresponded to [https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini). Now, I went about and downloaded the zip file and added it to the libraries but when I did the #include &lt;DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h&gt;, the DFRobotDFPlayer did not turn orange. 

Now, a few more google searches and apparently, it is missing the Keywords txt file. Now:

1. Does that render that library useless? 

2. Even if the DFRobot didn't turn orange, would it still work? Kinda relates to the aforementioned questions.

3. Is there a library that would work with my MP3-TF-16P module?

Kinda stressed about this so all the help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

Also, in the schematic is ""CLK"" and ""Control"".  Isn't the ""CLK"" the same as SCL?   I don't know where I'd connect that to my XIAO.  Similarly, the ""Control"" concerns me as maybe something specific to their DI wifi module that it is a shield for.  I dunno- clearly I'm new at this.

At first I was a bit confused by the mozzi library but now think I am wrapping my head around it a bit and wanted to test some sketches on protoboard but audio out is already soldered to pin 3. Was wondering if there's a simple way to change out pin to digital 3.

I thought I could change ""#define EXTERNAL_AUDIO_OUTPUT"" to true in mozzi_config.h and then use #define AUDIO_OUTPUT_PIN 3 but that doesnt work. Any ideas? Am I missing something?

Thought changing output in software would be easier than hardware but now I'm not so sure."

Basically, everything over 1 byte makes it produce garbage numbers after that. I can fix the issue by spamming it with a bunch of zeros.

arduino,Wifi LED strips?,[removed]
arduino,Looking for something to control a arduino leonardo pins,"I recently bought an Arduino Leonardo. Put XInput on it and am using 16 pins for the controls. (might be 20 if I can get the joystick buttons to work) Right now I am wondering how I can control those pins with like twitch or youtube live chat, From what I have noticed, the button inputs react to any type of ground. I plugged it into my raspberry pi zero GPIO pins (yeah, i know, bad idea) but noticed that they have a constantly flickering ground like off and on super fast. i was wondering if i can just use a pi or if i need to buy something else?"

arduino,Arduino and Dfplayer Mini Questions,"Ok I'm rigging up an arduino project with a dfplayer mini and got it working fine other than a little bit of a pop when it first starts but I think that's because it powered by the nano so planning on powering on it own 5 v. So now I'm about to put dfplayer on a blank pcb and rig it up with 3 screw terminals (tr/rx,power,speaker out) so I can easily test my other modules and to have a neat little package I can use for various projects etc


I've seen soo many different setups for speakers and for 1k resisters on both the rx/tx lines etc that wanted to verify some things before I start soldering lol.

A: I plan on wiring a 3 pin screw terminal for the speakers. (DAC-L&amp;R,Ground) which should give me stereo sound but at a low level earbuds sound and also wanted to rig the same terminals with the Spk1 &amp; 2 by adding jumpers I can swap from one pin/ line to the other,  so I would be able to switch as needed from amped mono to non amped stereo.

My question is does this sound right and will the jumpers effect the sound quality etc.

B: Should I use a 1k resister on both the rx,TX or just one? Any other place I might want stick a one for cleaner sound etc.

C: My power supply is kinda weird it but exactly what I need. It has 4pin connector with 12v and 5 v at 2amp and ground. My plan is to use 12 volt to power nano, stepper motor driver and then have the 5 power the dfplayer.

Question will this work(see any issues) and do I need to still ground my dfplayer to the nano or will it be ok since they are both on the same power ground anyway?

Any help is appreciated ill happily post it when I'm done."
arduino,TensorFlow Lite - Magic Wand on RTL8722DM," 

Materials

• Ameba D \[RTL8722 CSM/DM\] x 1  
• Adafruit LSM9DS1 accelerometer  
• LED x 2

Example

**Procedure**

Connect the accelerometer and LEDs to the RTL8722 board following the diagram.

&amp;#x200B;

Download the Ameba customized version of TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers library at [https://github.com/ambiot/ambd\_arduino/tree/master/Arduino\_zip\_libraries](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/tree/master/Arduino_zip_libraries).  
Follow the instructions at [https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries) to install it.  
Ensure that the patch files found at [https://github.com/ambiot/ambd\_arduino/tree/master/Ameba\_misc/](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/tree/master/Ameba_misc/) are also installed.  
In the Arduino IDE library manager, install the Arduino\_LSM9DS1 library. This example has been tested with version 1.1.0 of the LSM9DS1 library.  
Open the example, “Files” -&gt; “Examples” -&gt; “TensorFlowLite\_Ameba” -&gt; “magic\_wand”.

Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is finished.  
Holding the accelerometer steady, with the positive x-axis pointing to the right and the positive z-axis pointing upwards, move it following the shapes as shown, moving it in a smooth motion over 1 to 2 seconds, avoiding any sharp movements.

&amp;#x200B;

If the movement is recognised by the Tensorflow Lite model, you should see the same shape output to the Arduino serial monitor. Different LEDs will light up corresponding to different recognized gestures.  
Note that the wing shape is easy to achieve, while the slope and ring shapes tend to be harder to get right.

arduino,How do I set up an ANC system?,"So i was planning to test out an active noise canceling system where i get 2 microphone inputs, invert the polarity of the other one, multiply, and get ANC. I understand that the Arduino is capable of handling digital and analog signals. 

I have two main questions:

* Can the arduino multiply signals together such as my use case above? and if so, should i opt for an analog input or a digital input from a microphone module?
* If i opt for the digital microphone module, how clear would the audio be? im not sure of the range and sampling rate that the arduino can handle, i hear it could handle a range of 1023(and no idea of the sampling rate) although i have no experience with microphones and the arduino and have no idea if thats enough to have clear audio. It doesnt have to be perfect, just understandable. 

I'm very new to this....i appreciate any help at all

Thank you in advance!"
arduino,I need urgent assistance.," 

Hello there, I have a huge problem that I can't seem to crack. It's regarding project 8, Digital Hourglass contained in the Arduino Starter Kit, beginner level. *The code is available in the IDE.* File --&gt; Examples --&gt; 10. Starterkit\_Basickit --&gt; p08\_DigitalHourglass.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROBLEM:** All 6 LED's activate when the tilt sensor is closed and all turn off when tilt sensor is open. They each have to turn on separately once some time has elapsed. I'm not sure if its a hardware or software issue. I've double checked code and circuit and there are not similar issues online. Reddit is my last resort.

Why does this occur? The LED's are connected to digital terminals. I used battery and still. It's as if the code just get's ignored. Like if Arduino is powered, then LEDs are powered. I don't want this.

Also is the tilt sensor 4 input terminals? Which is which? In terms of placement on breadboard? I believe all pins get closed or open.

My code below. I changed the interval for 3 seconds for troubleshooting purposes. I am also using 3 LED's for simplicity thus my max x variable = 4.

Extra Notes:

* I am using correct COM port.
* I tried blink example and Arduino responds to this script.
* My LEDs are connected anode → cathode. Positive → Negative
* Farout, **new issue**. I cant view Serial Monitor SwitchState variable. Literally nothing shows up.

arduino,could use some help improving the bluetooth logic of this code I'm working on.,"So, I'm super new to all of this; my arduino uno starter kit was delivered 10 days ago, in fact. I'm working on some code for a project I'm working on and I have it mostly figured out, but I'm having one super minor issue.


here's the code;

}

What I'm working with is 2 LEDs that I want steady. and 1 LED that I want to blink. I have an HC-06 connected to the RX/TX pins of the arduino, which is receives serial data from an app on my phone.

Currently, I have it set so that 'a' turns the lights off, and 'b' turns the lights off. it works great, except for the blinking LED - blink1 in the code. where 'a' starts it fine, but 'b' only stops the *blinking*, if the LED is on, it stays on, if it's off, it stays off. and I can't quite figure out how to adjust the code so that instead of staying on/off, it turns it off and stays off. I've tried using

    if (c=='b'){
    isblink1 = false;
    digitalWrite(blink1, LOW);

to set the blink1 LED off as well as stopping the blink but that didn't work. I know there's something I'm missing/not understanding about this code but I can't figure out what.

arduino,Need help reading this schematic -- what orientation should I be putting the LEDs and the ambient light sensor?,"Hi!

I'm building this arduino ESP32 project that measures indoor air quality. The problem is the guide and the schematics are not clear which orientation I'm supposed to solder the ambient light sensor and the 3 LEDs:

https://github.com/nkitanov/iaq_board

schematic:

https://github.com/nkitanov/iaq_board/raw/master/images/schematic.png

This is the datasheet for the ambient light sensor:

data sheet for the LED:

https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/1138/SK6812+LED+datasheet+.pdf


The issue is I don't know which pins match with which pads on the PCB. For example, for the LED, the schematic positions each pin in the North, West, East, and South positions but the PCB has pads on the NW, SW, NE, SE corners. So how do I figure out which way to orient the LEDs?

Same issue with the ambient light sensor. Could really use your help! Thanks :)"
arduino,Can't push thermal camera refresh rate above 4hz,"I'm building a fairly simple system that includes a thermal camera. For ease of use I chose the MLX90640, with a pre-made breakout [as sold by Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4407). I'm using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 Express microprocessor, which is built around the ATSAMD51 chip, and writing my code in c++ in the Arduino IDE.

The camera communicates over I2C with a max clock speed of 1MHz, and a configurable refresh rate. Using the [provided example code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MLX90640/blob/master/examples/MLX90640_simpletest/MLX90640_simpletest.ino), I've been attempting to push the refresh rate as high as I can get it. In the listing Adafruit notes that while the manufacturer says the camera can go up to 32Hz, they were only able to get to 16Hz. So far in my experimentation any rate above 4Hz causes all reads to fail with an undocumented error code (-8), and in digging through [library code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MLX90640) I've found that this can indicate a number of failures, though it seems like the most likely is simply running out of read retries. Even at a 4Hz refresh rate, reads are abysmally slow, 500-700ms per frame. Complicating the question of why it's so slow is that the process for turning the returned data into actual temperature readings requires a goodly number of expensive floating point operations (sqrt, pow, and division-not-by-2), though the ATSAMD51 does include an FPU.

I've tried monkeying with the read mode (chessboard vs interleaved), the I2C wire speed, and the resolution, all without any luck. Unfortunately I don't have easy access to an oscilloscope for more in-depth hardware debugging.

I'm an experienced programmer, but very new to the hardware/microprocessor world. Specifically this is my first time using a device communicating over I2C and my understanding of the protocol is spotty at best.

arduino,Need extremely sensitive movement sensor for airsoft tracer unit,"Hey reddit,

I am new to Arduino and Co, but I wanted to make a Tracer Unit for an airsoft gun. These are sold commercially, but I wanted to try my hands at making one myself, because why not.

&amp;#x200B;

The Idea is basically to screw the device on the barrel and have a sensor detect a moving plastic pellet, which then tells the arduino nano to flash a few UV LEDs for a moment, which will make the phosphorescent Pellets glow.

I am practically done with everything; 3d modelling a main body and shell, printing it, soldering and assembling all parts aswell as the code. After putting it together, I noticed that the IR gate I am using (TRCT5000) isnt remotely sensitive enough. I am polling in the Loop without a delay and the sensor does not react to the bullet at all. Ive got it dialed in, so the output jumps from practically 0 to 1000 on the analog reading, when putting anything in the IR beam path. My softair rifle runs at 1.5J, which should come around to a muzzle velocity of 100m/s (BBs are 6mm). According to my calculations the time it takes the BB to fully pass a 6mm distance is 60ms (I should be considered mentally unfit to do any math to be honest though).

Any ideas for a sensor thats sensitive enough for that? Maybe straight up a weak laser hitting a photoresistor or something? I appreciate any input."

I found a tool called [EspExceptionDecoder](https://github.com/me-no-dev/EspExceptionDecoder), but I just have no idea on what the output means. [Here's a link to the output in PasteBin.](https://pastebin.com/ZV37x23P)

Here's the code for the NodeMCU (I used Arduino IDE 1.8.13): [https://pastebin.com/pkbXEsHa](https://pastebin.com/pkbXEsHa)  
And here's the Python code (3.9.1): [https://pastebin.com/3K3MV07u](https://pastebin.com/3K3MV07u)

So basically all this does is that the Python script sends ""d;"" to the NodeMCU's socket and it responds with a string that contains the orientation and a button status. Then the Python script splits it and maps it very crudely to screen coordinates (I know the implementation is really bad) and then uses win32api to move the cursor (the position is averaged because it was shaking so much) and press the left button. I have a guess that I have messed up with the pointers and refrences bc I have no idea how they work under the hood so if you have any ideas on what could be wrong I would really appreciate your help!"

I have a remote that controls some shades that I'm trying to automate by using a ESP8266 hooked to some optocouplers to mimic button presses.

The issue I have is that the metal plates that the button press into are really hard to solder -- the solder does not naturally stick to the button plates. In addition, I'm trying to power the remote using the 3.3v and gnd connections on my ESP8266, but the coin battery holder attached to the circuit board of the remote also does not seem to attract solder.

is there some way to get the solder to ""stick"" to the board?


Also ideally I would not want to solder the wires to each of the buttons on the remote in case I want to reverse the operation and restore the remote to the original state. Is there a good way to attach a wire to various metal connectors and stuff a bit less permanently (I tried to hot glue the wires to each of the pads and that didn't go so well, I think the hot glue seeped under the wires and plates and prevented good contact)."

arduino,Arduino control of 120v vacuum motor,"Looking to programmatically control the speed of this universal ac/dc motor https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000GJGMP2

The aim is to come up with a solution that is reasonably priced, practical, accurate, and durable.

It seems that phase angle control is common when controlling fans, but given that it's a 13 amp motor I'm concerned that the voltage spikes will cause too much EMI or possibly other problems that I'm not considering. If it's possible to power on the leading edge instead of the trailing edge I think that would avoid the voltage spikes, but TRIACs don't work that way and I'm unaware of what would.

Given that it's universal I think it should be possible to power it using DC with pwm, but my understanding is that the chopped DC signal from pwm would lead me back into EMI problems.

The only other solution I'm aware of is using a VFD, but I'd need a single phase in single phase out VFD which aren't very common, so costs would go up.

Maybe the EMI isn't as much of a concern as I think it will be, but I'm not sure.

Could anyone let me know what approach they would take, and more importantly why they would take that approach? And yes, I fully understand the safety concerns of working with mains power. I'd like to learn from this exercise, as many of my future project ideas seem to revolve around the control of motor speed (and heater power, but zero-crossing SSRs seem fine for that for now).

My daughter is home for the summer, and with her bedroom at the far end of the house, she complains that she doesn't know if the house is armed or not at night. So...

I really should have published this in the ESP32 sub, but I can't add a ""Look what I made' flair there.

What did this involve?

1) Had to install Homebridge on a Pi to monitor all the devices on my network. When the alarm panel changes state, the event is detected by Homebridge. There is a plug-in for my alarm manufacturer.

2) Had to add a Homebridge plug-in to node-red (also running on the same Pi).

3) Node-red flow detects alarm event from Homebridge and publishes an MQTT message to my Mosquitto MQTT broker (also running on the Pi).

4) ESP32 (Huzzah32 from Adafruit) is subscribed to the ALARMSTATUS message and parses the JSON payload to detect if the alarm panel is unarmed or armed and set the Neopixel to green or red depending.

All this just to indicate the alarm status remotely."

First thank you for spending time to read my post.

Recently I am making a small project about gardening and I use Arduino Uno to process the automation part. As I use three sensors : The temperature/humidity sensor (DHT11) [pin 7], the soil moisture sensor (YL69) [pin A0] and the rain sensor [pin A1]. The data is send through the HC06 Bluetooth module.

The Arduino is powered by an 12V 1.5A adapter. The others four are powered by an 5V 1A mobile charger. Here where the problem appears: At first all the light indicators of all four modules is on, and the data is transmitted to my computer through the HC06, but I noticed that the data was weird, that is the temperature sensor DHT11 is just from 6 to 8 celcius. I thought that the sensor is broken but when I unplugged all the sensors and wired the DHT11 with the Arduino only (this time the DHT11 is powered by the  Arduino), everything is normal, but that is only I powered the DHT11 with the mobile charger power supply, the result return ""nan"".

I was thinking that the problem came from the power supply, am I right? Was the power supply current is not enough to power all fours modules?

Every answers, comments are appreciated.

Thank you."

Im building a project that includes the use of a 6 position rotary switch. The way i have wired it up in an effort to save a lot of pins being taken up on my arduino, is iv soldered a 1k resistor inbetween each pole that the switch uses, with 5v on the first pole and the last pole going to ground, and then the common is going to an analog input on my arduino.
This works well as when i run the program and watch the serial monitor, as i switch through each position on the rotary switch, the value on the monitor jumps up in value of about roughly 200 (eg. Position 1=0, position 2=200, all the way up through the six stages until finally it sits at 1023).

My question here is, i would like to transfer these values to print on the monitor as position 1, and position 2 ect..
And im having trouble figuring out how to do this. I feel like as my values showing currently are not super conistant, as they jump around by 3 or 4 values, and dont just stay on an excact number, that any sort of mathmatical equation is ruled out.
Is there a way to say if these values are inbetween x and y then it is equal to position 1, and if the values are inbetween a and b then it is equal to position 2?

This is irrelevant information, but it may be an interesting project overview for someone: I have a functional hardware setup. An automobile supplies 12 volts through two wires. One is the signal for running lights the other is intermittent signal from blinkers. I need these two signals to both control a single LED. This is easy to accomplish with simple if, and if else statements. ie. 

If running light on OR Signal light on,  turn LED on.

Else if running light on AND Signal light on turn LED off.

Else Turn LED off

The problem is that the blink phase is opposite for the first two conditions. In the first a positive signal from blinkers turns on the LED. In the second a positive signal from blinkers turns off the LED. The 12v signal from the GMC blinks with a period of 1000ms, 500ms ON then 500ms OFF. To get the blinker back in phase I want to implement a delayed signal to the LED. Upon receiving both signals from Blinker and Running lights I want the Arduino to keep the light on for 500ms while still looking for a change in signals coming from the GMC. If a change is detected boot out of the while loop and go back into the the main void loop which cycles through the if statements. However, if no change occurs in those 500ms then the LED gets turned off for the next 500ms. This is a blind 500ms. Nothing can change (The LED stays OFF) until the time runs out."

arduino,"Need help with Serial Plotter, I can't seem to figure out how to make it scale.","I have 5 sensors reading different values, it's working great, but I need to plot it on a graph in real time.  I've been scaling the data, and that works, but the serial plotter doesn't always change.

It's picking up spaces and other data and I'm lost on what it picks up and how it labels things.

I've been using Serial.print("" MyValue : "" + String(myVar));

I print about 5 of these on a line and it works great for reading, but I need to plot it.

The serial plotter is picking up the values, but it has a bunch of labels at the top and I can't figure out its auto scale stuff.  I've even set a max value to 20 just to try to get the scale to go down, but it doesn't always work.

Any info on how it work would be great, thanks!"
arduino,Analog Joystick switch not working,"Hi there, I'm pretty new to electronics and Arduino, and I have this problem that is stumping me. I have an analog joystick with 5 pins (+5v, GND, VRx, VRy, and SW) connected to my Arduino Nano. My problem is with the switch pin, which is connected to pin 13. The X and Y axis work fine, so I know that power is not the problem. The problem is that I can't seem to get the switch to be responsive. It only outputs 0, or LOW. I have looked on the internet and seen many things, but here are a list of things I have tried and that haven't worked. (note: I know there is nothing wrong with my loop, so I have only been using one loop. But the loop is: 

    Serial.println(digitalRead(SWpin));
    delay(1000);

so I'm not going to include my loop in each different setup I write. So I've tried this:

    const int SWpin = 13;
    void setup() {
        pinMode(SWpin, INPUT)
    }

and this:

    const int SWpin = 13;
    void setup() {
        pinMode(SWpin, INPUT_PULLUP);
    }

and this because I saw this was a solution on the internet:

    const int SWpin = 13;
    void setup() {
        pinMode(SWpin, INPUT);
        digitalWrite(SWpin, HIGH);
    }

I also tried:

    const int SWpin = 13;
    void setup() {
        pinMode(SWpin, INPUT_PULLUP);
        digitalWrite(SWpin, HIGH);
    }

So I don't know what to do. Also, before you tell me my switch is broken, if I use the example that comes with the ""AxisJoystick"" library the switch works, but I don't want to upload the entire library to the Arduino just for the switch, because I know there's a way to make the switch work without the library and memory is limited for this project. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks for taking time out of your day to help a noob."

arduino,Detecting water presence in a pipe using Arduino,"Hello!

I am currently building my own AC condensation exhaust pump (I know there are already built solutions but they're 2-3x more expensive then what I can manage DYI-ing it.)

So far I have the reservoir, water exhaust hose and pump all sorted out. Last thing I need is for the pump to start by itself when the water reaches a certain level. (Arduino time)

The pump is a 250W AC little unit, it has 1"" intake and exhaust pipe diameter. The exhaust is on the house's roof so after the pump it leaves via a garden hose upwards.

Although I could use a common sensor in the reservoir, I am not sure I will keep this reservoir so I want to do it differently: The pump is always connected to the reservoir, so, water level rises in the pumping system at the same time it rises in the reservoir, so, instead of sensing the water in the reservoir, I want to sense it directly into the pipe above the pump itself.

What would be a simple solution to detect the presence of water inside of the pipe (brass, 1"" or hose, 1/2"" plastic) so I can further control the pump?"

arduino,Is an Arduino 33 BLE or Arduino 33 IOT more suited to control a stepper motor remotely?,"Here's what I want to achieve:

A nice bonus would be a solution that doesn't require a router or one where I can control it with my phone too.

arduino,"LTE-M module MQTT library, and freertos","I've got a SARA R410M module connected to my ESP32 and I want to do secure MQTT with AWS IoT.

I have everything working manually with AT commands over UART, and I also got something working with TinyGSM but it uses Pubsubclient which doesn't support QOS 1 publish (which I need). 

I think that means I need to implement my own code to manage UART I/O. 

My application needs to use Freertos tasks and is very power constrained (trying to downclock as far as possible,  and sleep as much as possible). Rather than poll the UART for data available like most libraries I've seen, can I use an ISR?

How do I structure tasks and buffers in freertos to, for example, distinguish between the response to an AT command issued and the module notifying of incoming TCP data over the MQTT connection (result when another client published to a subscribed topic)?

Are there examples of libraries which do this kind of thing I can study?"
arduino,Single plane display clock?,"https://youtu.be/0TD_MhPpZKg

I’ve been fascinated by single plane displays since I was a kid. Of course, I didn’t know that term (and only learned a few months ago). But I was always excited to see them on TV (the scoring displays on the original “Password”) or in an elevator. Disney World had several of them in Tomorrowland, way back. I figured they were projectors, but I was always stumped because in my experience, I had never seen slides change that quickly or cleanly. 
 
So. I’d like to make a clock using them. My figuring is that it’s not too dissimilar to a Nixie tube clock (light up one element per digit) but with far less voltage. There’s still some new old stock available, but not at a price I can afford. I’m happy to use LEDs for this, because authenticity isn’t a concern for me. I can 3D print enclosures, with trial and error. I can get film made. The only thing that’s stumping me is finding or fabricating the lenses. 
 
So I guess my questions are:
• Does this approach make sense?
• Any insight on the lenses?"

arduino,Recommendations to construct a custom low-powered GPS tracker,"Disclaimer: This is my first post in this community and I am not an expert at all with all this DIY things so forgive me if what I am asking is not appropriate or too dummy.

We are a group of people that have a party boat in Berlin (Germany, Europe), we have always the problem that someone comes late when the boat is already moving and she has to find where the boat is so she can intercept it and and jump in.

For this we use the usual Whatsup location things a bit messy and very ad-hoc.

Also there is the problem that when the boat is park we want to know if there is any strange activity and if it is moving when it shouldn't.

For both of this problems I am thinking in installing a GPS tracker. The problem is mostly electricity. The boat has a car battery that is charged by solar panels or by the engine when it is running.

I see there are many commercial solutions for this but I don't see any that satisfy all my needs:

- Possibility to be connected to the boat battery (car battery), or to a USB charger (the boat has USB chargers, enough to charge a phone, connected to the battery)
- At the same time it has a small rechargeable battery as a fallback in case the main battery is gone 
- Send the location to a custom URL (I am developer I am happy to make an app using this data)

The range has to be Berlin and 100km around (doesn't need to be international)

So, I will be very happy to build this thing my self using Arduino or any other DIY low cost technology.

I was doing a small google research and I found this: 

- https://www.instructables.com/LTE-NB-IoT-Shield-for-Arduino/

Looks exactly what I need:

- Full instructions
- Not very expensive components (GPS module cost 75€ in Amazon)
- It is using LTE CAT-M1 and/or NB-IoT technology, what I understand is the actually better 
- Low power mode drawing &lt; 8uA (not sure if this is low or not :))
- Mobile connection with Hologram.io that looks it has good coverage and good prices


But before I started to dive into this I wanted to ask to this community if I am following the right path.

- Can you recommend any tutorial to create a GPS tracker as I need?
- Do you have any recommendation for me?
- Do you have any experience building something similar? 
- Do you have any comment about the above article I am about to follow? 
- Is there any comercial solution do you want me to take a look?


Any thought is welcome :)"

I'm looking to convert it to a neopixel matrix now for larger size and better visibility when sunlight comes in the room windows.

What would be super great is if there's a way to drive a neopixel display from that same web page. I know there will be resolution loss but that isn't a problem since it only ever shows a single amount or bar chart at a time. I've tested down to the target resolution of the display to be built.

*Ideally* I'd be able to configure a box that takes VGA or HDMI as an input and ""look"" like just a low res external monitor and I wouldn't have to change anything for the display software. I've seen on YouTube that people can send webcam video to a nepixel display so I figure it should be possible to send web page content. I've looked at Node and Python packages that rasterize HTML to png that I could use to map RGB values to each pixel but that doesn't work fast enough (there are animations for when an order comes in that scrolls the numbers to count up to the new total).

Does anyone know of a package where I could just point a web page, or a region of one, and have it display on a neopixel matrix? I'd rather not have to completely rewrite the code in order to make it work on the LED's."

arduino,Thinking about making something to notify me when someone buzzes my apartment or knocks the door.,"Hello, excuse my lack of knowledge for this sort of thing, I am completely new to it but have always been interested and I finally have a reason to learn.

I've just moved into an apartment and there is a small entrance room with the door phone beside the front door. Problem is, it is not very loud and when I have headphones on in my office, I pretty much can't hear it at all. If I am expecting a delivery, I will keep my headphones off, but otherwise I wear them all day. 

So my thinking was, to have a wireless set up, with a sound sensor mounted to the frame of the door. If there is either a knock at the door or the buzzer sounds, then it will trigger an LED on my desk (or a notification to my phone/PC?) and I will then know. 

What I am wondering is:

1) Is this a good idea or stupid?

2) If it is possible, what do I need to buy? There is no power in that room, so it will need to run on batteries. I have no idea what the best method of doing this is, I have done some searches and found a few similar projects, but many seemed to involve taking things apart and wiring up to the door bell, which isn't something I can do. 

Thanks in advance for your help."

I read that you can change the firmware of the mega to use it as HID.  
[https://github.com/NicoHood/Hoodloader](https://github.com/NicoHood/Hoodloader)  
after doing that the IDE cannot be used again, so you must load the sketch before flashing it as HID.  
/\* With the files that are there you can re-flash the firmware of the mega as many times as possible, that is, you can return from hid to the original firmware as many times as you want \*/  


as i am a newbie I do not understand how to use as keyboard...  
i found this to be a ""programmable keyboard"" but i need a keyboard ... not a programmable keyboard  


this is the code: [https://create.arduino.cc/editor/otazzzku/4b6543c5-27b0-41bc-afc5-bfd94898a177/preview](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/otazzzku/4b6543c5-27b0-41bc-afc5-bfd94898a177/preview)

arduino,LCD display like wristwatches,"I'm designing a speedometer for my bike and I'm using the traditional 4 digit 7 segment display, a red one specifically.

Problem is that is barely visible in daylight which makes it completely pointless

My father suggested using something like  a wristwatch display, they are visible on any type of light plus they have a bakclight for low light conditions.

Now, a cursory search on Amazon returned no results, as they don't seem to be as common as the traditional 7segment displays

Have you all ever used a display like that in an arduino project? Is there a standard one I can buy? (4 digits is enough for me)? What about designing them, can you print them on jlcpcb?"

arduino,Controlling a Gamecube with an Arduino,"Hello,

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the [simple controllers project](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/5med66/how_to_make_your_own_smash_box_xpost_rssbm/). I need some help, this is the code [I bodged together](https://pastebin.com/5Aw1rdqs). Essentially the SC's project relates to building a smashbox for the Gamecube, however I have other plans.


I have everything I believe wired up correctly (im currently using an arduino uno instead of a mega), according to the Simple Controllers guide. What I want to do is have the code send a 'A' button pressed signal, every second (for testing). However, nothing happens and I have no clue what I did wrong. No errors pop up during verification.


Once solved, I want to have the arduino read inputs from my playstation 3 controller and then translate it to gamecube button presses. Essentially, I know how to do the latter and just struggling to get started.


Thank you!"

Turn a higher torque servo with an arduino (actually an esp32, but I'm pretty sure the hardware needs are the same). I'm happy to power the board via usb, but I know that I need to have an external power supply for the servo. 

There are two main things I'm considering:

1. Some kind of power source that can power both the USB and the servo (so it would provide power separately to the arduino and to the servo – not sure if this exists, but would be very nice if it does). If I went this route, I'd love to plug the whole thing into the wall and skip batteries altogether. 
2. Some sort of battery to provide the power to the servo. What I've heard is that some kind of relay is the way to go because it keeps the battery from getting drained while the servo isn't running. Is this correct? What does the wiring look like? I've tried googling it, but it's just not super obvious from what I've researched and I'm pretty confused.

Thanks for the help!"

arduino,Mosfet and LED Circuit Acting Weird," [https://imgur.com/it7hpqG](https://imgur.com/it7hpqG)

Above is the circuit I am working with. And as in the circuit, I am using an IRLZ44N mosfet.

The following is the code I am working with.

`int mosfetPin = 6;`

`void setup() {`

  `pinMode(mosfetPin, OUTPUT);`

`}`

`void loop() {`

  `for (int i = 0; i &lt; 255; i++)`

  `{`

`analogWrite(mosfetPin, i);`

`delay(100);`

  `}`

`}`

As you can see, it is all pretty straightforward.

But when using this setup, the LEDs do not dim properly. And will even stay on if disconnected from the Arduino. What am I missing?"

arduino,Using a button as a toggle an getting only one read at a time?,"I had a button read in a loop and the problem that I was having is that the button was used as a toggle to rotate thru choices.  When I pressed the button, it would keep reading for as long as I pressed it and sometimes it would screw up the effect I wanted.

So I set a delay when the button was detected and then set a var.  It seems to work, but I'm wondering if anyone has a better way of reading a button only once when it's being presses without reading it again until it's pressed again.

I don't want a standard on/off switch, I want to press X times to select a function.  So if the user presses it 3 times, they get 3 choices down from where they are currently.  This allows me to have say, 10 options and every time the press the button, it goes down one more option from where they are.  A standard on/off switch wouldn't do that, it has to be the momentary type."

I did a small arduino project for my mom. She likes to have bird feeders and one has some peanuts in it which the birds like alot. However some crows are taking over and fighting the other birds to have all the peanuts to themselves. So I build a small arduino project which has a buzzer and a phone vibrator which are linked with a specific button on the IR controller. Everything works fine, but the range is very limited, like within 6 feet.

I tried changing the battery (CR2025) of the controller to no avail. Brought the setup back inside to verify it wasnt the environment, it wasnt. 

However, even if im inside the house and I point the controller at the feeder, I can see the LED on the IR receiver light up so it is indeed receiving a transmission even at about 8 meters. However I believe the signal isnt strong enough to make it work above 6 feet.

What's the weakpoint of this setup? The receiver or the emitter? They're both basic modules that came with an elegoo kit.

arduino,BME680 Gas resistance scale?,"I'm working with an Arduino Metro (equivalent to Arduino Uno) and a BME680 sensor - which reads temperature, humidity, pressure, and can sense volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

All I've been able to find so far is that when the gas resistance is low, the concentration of VOCs is high - yet I can't find any indication of what ""low"" actually is.

I would like to keep my current set-up as it's for a research project.

arduino,Using a pc PSU to power 5V led strip?,"I just bought a 5V WS2812B led strip of 4m. The store where I bought it mentions 18W/m needed to power the strip. So if I did the math right I would need a 5V power supply with 14.4A.

Now, after looking for an inexpensive power supply I realized I have an unused PC PSU (be quiet! BQT-L7-350W) that can output 15A at 5V.

Would this be just as good as any other power supply for powering the strip?

arduino,Port greyed out,"Hi, 

I am currently doing a project with a TFT display and ran into some issues. I usually work from my school computer and everything runs normally. Today, I tried it on mine and I noticed that the serial port was greyed out. Not that I had not run the code from this computer before, so it was basically the first time using Arduino IDE from my laptop. 

So, here is the problem:

For most of my personal projects so far, ranging from large to small, all I have used are breadboards (I am beginning to venture into the solderless breadboard realm, but might go for a normal breadboard for my latest project.)

Recently, I read online that breadboards should not be subjected to more than 1A of current. This seems quite low, and I am unsure if what I am doing is safe.

I am using [these breadboards,](https://www.amazon.com/Breadboards-Solderless-Breadboard-Distribution-Connecting/dp/B07DL13RZH/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=breadboard+arduino&amp;qid=1624562238&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQ1ZRMDlNMTYwUDFWJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTQyNzk4TkxTNjlKN043MUMzJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3ODI1MDYzOTdGQVNNODVCT0g1JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) and in the description it says it can handle from 3-5A @ 300V. With this breadboard, I built a Rubik's cube solving machine using 1.5A stepper motors and A4988 stepper drivers running at 12V. Although only one motor is moving at any one time (I might up this to two), the breadboard seems to have no problem handling this.

With my latest project, it too will run off of this breadboard and stepper motors, and might have 2 moving simultaneously (though I might be able to get away with one). Is what I am doing safe? Am I pushing too much current through the board? Because it seems to be just fine from what I have seen.

I have no experience designing PCBs, so I don't want to do that, and do not know of any other high current breadboard alternatives? Any tips/suggestions? Will I be fine, and can I use a breadboard for my latest project?"

arduino,How to create WebServer WITHOUT HTML browser interface to communicate with Python client via Ethernet?,"Hi everyone,

I am fairly new to Arduino and a complete novice at websocket communication. Currently for my job, I am trying to code a WebServer on my Arduino Uno R3 with an Arduino Ethernet 2 Shield (WizNet W5500). The purpose of this WebServer is to to store some float value (that in my final version would like to be the number of pulses from a Hall Sensor for measuring water flow, but this has been neglected for now), this double value is then sent to a Python WebClient which then outputs the value to a .txt file. The plan would also be for this client to query the WebServer every second.

I have noticed in the pre-built example 'WebServer' , the code inside the loop() involves HTML in order to output the results to a browser when queried, for example:

    client.println(""HTTP/1.1 200 OK"");
              client.println(""Content-Type: text/html"");
              client.println(""Connection: close"");  // the connection will be closed after completion of the response
              client.println(""Refresh: 5"");  // refresh the page automatically every 5 sec
              client.println();
              client.println(""&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;"");
              client.println(""&lt;html&gt;"");

For my purpose, I do not want any of this HTML stuff, since I simply want to just want to send a value directly to the client when queried, rather than displaying it on a web browser.

However, I have also been told that I need this HTML in place as it is a communications protocol, but I honestly have no idea.

I have tried redesigning the given 'WebServer' example, where I have removed the HTML stuff and also stopped the client connection from closing (do I need to close it each time after sending the value to the client). This code is shown below:

    #include &lt;SPI.h&gt;
    #include &lt;Ethernet.h&gt;
    
    // Enter a MAC address and IP address for your controller below.
    // The IP address will be dependent on your local network:
    byte mac[] = {0xA8, 0x61, 0x0A, 0xAE, 0x69, 0x13};
    IPAddress ip(198, 162, 1, 177);
    
    // Initialize the Ethernet server library
    // with the IP address and port you want to use
    // (port 80 is default for HTTP):
    EthernetServer server(80);
    
    // Purpose of this code is to send a 1.00 value to the client every time it is queried by the client
    
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);  //Starting serial monitor
    
      while (!Serial) {
        ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
      }
      Serial.println(""Ethernet WebServer Example"");
    
      // start the Ethernet connection and the server:
      Ethernet.begin(mac, ip);
    
      // Check for Ethernet hardware present
      if (Ethernet.hardwareStatus() == EthernetNoHardware) {
        Serial.println(""Ethernet shield was not found.  Sorry, can't run without hardware. :("");
        while (true) {
          delay(1); // do nothing, no point running without Ethernet hardware
        }
      }
      if (Ethernet.linkStatus() == LinkOFF) {
        Serial.println(""Ethernet cable is not connected."");
      }
    
      // start the server
      server.begin();
      Serial.print(""server is at "");
      Serial.println(Ethernet.localIP());
    }
    
    
    
    void loop() {
    // If the client is connected, send the value of 1.00 to the client
      EthernetClient client = server.available();
      if (client)
      {
        boolean currentLineIsBlank = true;
        while (client.connected())
            {
              delay(2000);
              client.print(1.00);
              client.println();
            }
    
      }
     
    }

How do I alter this code in order for it to send 1.00 back to the client each time it is queried?

arduino,Scaling NeoPixel/FastLED code examples by 16,"Hello reddit,

this is my first reddit post ever. I am having a coding issue some others might also be interested in in a similar fashion. I am not very skilled in coding, however I try to apply (known) basic principles. I hope the problem description is sufficient. :)

**Thanks a lot. :)**

**Question:**

I am trying to figure out the best way to scale the NeoPixel/FastLED code examples by the factor 16.

**Context:**

I am building a LED wall out of metal cans, which consists of LED Rings (consisting out of 16 LEDs), which act like ""pixels"". The challenge I am facing is that since when one uses addressable LEDs, the desired outcome is to have blocks of 16 LEDs that, repsectively, have the same RGB color value for blocks 16 LEDs.

(My LED rings of 16 can be seen as individual LED strips with a length of 16 LEDs each.)

**Complication:**

I will turn a light diffusor material on the metal cans, such that the individual LEDS cannot longer be seen. Hence, if the RGB colors are not altered in blocks of 16, this would eventually give a blurred grey color.  


**Solution approaches so far:**

**Example 1:**

I tried to alter the increment in the for loop from ""i++"" to ""i+16"", however the outcome did not change.

**from ""strandtest"" in the NeoPixels examples:**

`rainbow(10)`

**Initial function of example 1:**

`void colorWipe(uint32_t color, int wait) {`  
  `for(int i=0; i&lt;strip.numPixels(); i++) { // For each pixel in strip...`  
`strip.setPixelColor(i, color);         //  Set pixel's color (in RAM)`  
[`strip.show`](https://strip.show)`();                          //  Update strip to match`  
`delay(wait);                           //  Pause for a moment`  
  `}`  
`}`

**My attempt altering example 1:**

`void colorWipe(uint32_t color, int wait) {`

  `for(int i=0; i&lt;strip.numPixels(); i+16) { // For each pixel in strip...`

`strip.setPixelColor(i, color);         //  Set pixel's color (in RAM)`

**Example 2:**

I tried to think of a way to alter the array(?) `CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS]` which stores the RGB values for each LED of a LED strip.

So the idea was that I would run sample code unaltered, but then create a second `CRGB leds2[NUM_LEDS2]` object that would be a ""scaled array"" of `CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS]` and eventually feed the arduino with it. Is there an even better approach to recycle the FastLED sample code?

  
I attached a picture video that visually illustrates my questions.

I'd love to know which parts I need to purchase exactly in order to build a simple Arduino device that plugs into an outlet / USB power, has a WIFI adapter that allows it to connect to my home internet, a motion detector and an LED. 

The device will download the weather report every 20 minutes and based on the likelihood of rain in the next 8 hours, it will turn on the LED lights only when motion is detected. My plan is to build this device into an Umbrella stand so that when I walk by it, if rain is expected, the umbrella stand will light up with the LEDs. I know this isn't a new idea but I can't find any for sale and I really want one at home.

arduino,"Just got my new mega, are you supposed to do something special to it, it is this broken?","Background and update:

I had 1 mega from Sunfounder as part of a kit.  It was working great and I was making an automotive oscilloscope.  All the sudden it stopped loading new programs.  Ends up it's actually still running the last program just fine, but times out on loading a new one.

Known problem with the mega and the solution is to load with a specific loader device, load with another Arduino or reburn the loader (I think).

------------------------------------

I ordered a mega with case for $16.30 for mega, case, cable and taxes.  Guy I know said ""I have one, you can have it"".  He gave me a true Arduino Mega from Italy with some solder and missing a plastic pin holder, but works.  Loaded a program, no problem so far.

I then open the new one from eBay and it has two small red LEDs flashing and those are different.  It's not being seen by my computer.  I go back and check the other two boards and they are being seen on that port, but the new one isn't.

All that happens is that the new one flashes two red LEDs that are not on the other mega boards.

Maybe this is a new version of the mega, IDK.  Is there something special that I'm supposed to do?  The ad says mega R3 and the other boards I see are different from the one in the picture:

Actual item I got in the mail:

https://www.ebay.com/itm/132940101129

You can see the board is different from the Sunfounder and the true Arduino from Italy.

When the number of button presses exceeds three (or is equal to 4 in the case of my code), a quick animation is played and then it resets the counter (all LED's off too). 

My problem is that when I press the button for the first time, either after uploading the code or after the counter resets, the Arduino blinks and registers the button press, but then the value doesn't change in the serial nor does the LED light up. It is only on the second press that 1 is added to the count, and the LED lights up. Can anyone offer any assistance to solve this? Any help would be very much appreciated! :D

In their current configuration, the resistors are parallel to the breadboard and cover a decent amount of space. I'm using 1000 ohm resistors, and my questions are as follows.

Would setting up the resistors to go straight up and then down into another pin immediately adjacent be viable?

If not, are there any resistors that would be seated vertically, similarly to how a capacitor is seated in a breadboard?

The regulator is optional and the VIN goes to the RAW pin of the Mini and lets the onboard regulator do the powering. You will have to solder the jumper pad to use a regulator.  If a regulator is not used, then VIN EXT can be used for external ""V"" pin header powering. This will allow for more power/voltage for servos or other devices.

This board *should* work for the three most common pin configurations.

They can be found here [https://github.com/jscottb/pcbs](https://github.com/jscottb/pcbs) along with others I have made.

arduino,How to power Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense,"I'm new to Arduino, and I would like to make sure I know how to power the board correctly.

I've connected the board to my computer, and monitored that it uses 100mA of current. If I were to use a USB wall power adapter that outputs 500mA, will this higher amp output break the board?

How should I approach power requirements in general? Thanks!"

arduino,Communicating to 1000+ WS2812 LEDs via Teensy 4.0 issues,"Hello all, 

Some background specs of my project:

&amp;#x200B;

See the schematic showing how items are connected. 

5V 60A PSU

Teensy 4.0

WS2812 LEDs

Windows PC + Touch screen

The basic idea is that the touchscreen has buttons that allows the user to select which pattern they want to see on the lights. When they select Pattern 1, a string of 1920 characters get sent via serial to the Teensy. The string going through a loop where each character represents the colour that associated LED must light up. 

The pattern is static. Nothing fancy. 

The code being used to control the LEDs.

Now comes the issues:

&amp;#x200B;

When I test my programme at the desk it works no problem with a strip of 30 LEDs. 

I have used a basic LED test on the lights (Lights up all the LEDs one at a time starting with Red, Green, Blue, Yellow etc.) So I know the connections are all okay.

When I try my programme, I start seeing unreliable data communication. I press the button for Pattern 1 and where the lights are meant to be green, they show multiple faded colours. When I press it again, it gets a little better and then I press it again and it might all be correct. 

The photos show examples of what I mean. 

It seems the more I use the system the more reliable it becomes. 

After some research I feel it could be:

1. Teensy data output is 3.3v and the WS2812B expects 5v Din. I am going to order a  TC4427 logic level converter to try out. (as advised by [https://electricfiredesign.com/2021/03/12/logic-level-shifters-for-driving-led-strips/](https://electricfiredesign.com/2021/03/12/logic-level-shifters-for-driving-led-strips/))
2. Potentially the computer not being grounded with the teensy? I am not sure what would be required to ground these items. I would have thought the USB would have grounded them. 
3. Loose connections around the lights, although, I think this can be ruled out with the other Demos working well?
4. The code missing some lines of best practice: delays etc.

Any help will be more than welcomed. Really appreciate the help I get from everyone.

I am trying to power two Arduinos via 5v that power a few peripherals (around 100mA current draw on each) using a 7v/3W solar panel and a 4000mA 3.7v lipo battery. I have no idea how to wire this circuit, it's beyond me at the moment.

My idea was to use a 9V solar panel charging module to charge the 3.7v lipo and wire the battery 3.7v output on the module to a 5v regular and connect the two arduinos to the 5v? This seems like bad practice/design. What do you guys recommend?"

So; without buying new boards (copies or real) and re-soldering every connection etc - is there a way I can solder to the board and get USB working again - perhaps this is what the RX/TX and what-not are for? It's in a fixed position ([inside this](https://imgur.com/zaQ5Zfg)) so having the USB wire direct to the board permanently is no problem.

I'm actually surprised it broke, inside the wheel with everything cable-tied down inside. Shows how weak it is :(

Hello together,

im a little bit frustrated. I bought the NHD-12864AZ Display. Its a 128x64 Display.  
But the documentation about it is so scarce. I wanted to use the u8g2 library and went with  
common tutorials about 128x64 Displays because the pinout is essentialy the same on all of them. But it doesnt work. not even remotely. I know you have to uncomment the display you are using but none of the NHD Displays in the sample code do anything. Does someone have experience with this exact Display? Thank you for reading and helping"

Hello everyone, I am manufacturing reverse vending machines in India.

the machine is ready and it is working properly but we are stuck at one place that is the touch screen display 

I will explain as clearly as possible in pointers what I need so that someone out of you intelligent people can help me 

1. the display I will be using will be a normal touchscreen panel
2. the touchscreen panel will display, please insert bottle into the machine
3. when someone inserts the bottle into the machine it will show please select the voucher and enter your mobile number 
4. I have got software created for the 3rd step

But where I am stuck comes here,

how will the machine get to know when it has to switch from 

""please insert bottle"" to  ""please select voucher""

so someone told me when the bottle passes through the sensor, the sensor will give a command to the raspberry pi which in return will give the command to display that it has to change the screen now 

so how will it work ad how to make it work is what I want to know fo0rmk, you people

can someone please help me how is it going to work with the raspberry pi"

arduino,Execution skips a few lines for no reason,"Hi everyone. I'm working on my grade project: making a bluetooth-controlled car. The hardware is: 4 motors, an arduino uno, a l298n motor driver, and an hc-05 bluetooth receiver. [Here's](https://gitlab.com/Night_H4nter/grade-firmware/-/tree/master) the code and mostly accurate principal scheme (the button is actually on different pins, and both ""enable"" have jumpers on them).

The idea is that it's controlled with ASCII characters sent from something (a phone in my case). The characters are `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` or `s` for left, back, forward, right and stop, respectively. And there are also digits (0-9) that define a count. Rotation is done dumb way: send `h`/`l` to start rotating clockwise/anti clockwise, and `s` to stop. Moving forward/backwards is done by (optionally) sending the amount of decimeters the car should travel with a digit(s), and then (mandatory) send the direction with `j`/`k` for backwards/forward.

The issue is: when `makemove()` function from [action.cpp](https://gitlab.com/Night_H4nter/grade-firmware/-/blob/master/action.cpp) is called, the motors are turned on, but not turned off, regardless of `delay()` argument.

       case forward:
            moveforward();                      
            /* delay( delayfromcount(count) );  //commented for debug */
            delay(100);                         /*added for debug, execution
                                                presumably skips this*/

            return true;
            break;

Sending `s` stops motors just fine though. I'd gladly make use of some help here, thanks in advance."

arduino,"LED Strip (Adalight) wiring using USB and external power, something is wrong but I'm clueless","I'm trying to build an Ambilight setup but since I messed with the chinese kit I ordered, I think I bricked the fake Arduino so I got a real Arduino Uno R3.

I have tried to do the most commonly seen wiring scheme for this, which is 5V to 5V LED Pin, GRD for Arduino GRD + LED GRD and Pin 6 to LED DIN Pin. I'm also using the Hyperion Adalight sketch.

I've seen videos on the matter and the strip just lights up instantly, which is baffling me by now. Like this one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgII4UYW5hU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgII4UYW5hU) pretty much the same wiring, just the lack of the capacitor.

The thing is, I cannot turn on these led strips at all. I've tried changing baud rates, different test sketches, different software, nothing works. Then I noticed that the power supply does not have its' blue LED on, even when plugged in, so I'm assuming I messed up something with it. I removed the DC plug from it and did the wiring directly, does it need to be a male - female plug connection instead?

I'm very new to this and sorry if I sound too dumb or confused, this has been driving me insane and I've spent countless hours searching and having no results.

I posted more info here, although I ended up not powering the Arduino with 5V from the schematic here:

arduino,Did I just destroy the programmer on my Arduino?,"So I was working on a new project and had a simple read a button, turn on an LED.  Worked fine, then all the sudden my MacBook Pro shuts down, like it went into sleep mode, but then it starts back up, so it shut down instead of going into sleep mode.

Then I try loading the sketch again and it gives me an error:


avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00

I remove the cable, reset the Arduino, same thing.  Shut down the computer, remove all jumpers from the Arduino and verify the port works by plugging in my iPhone.

- The USB port works because my iPhone is seen on that port.
- the code compiles and I've tried different samples built in.
- the old code is still loaded into the Arduino, and still works fine.
- I turned off everything, rebooted everything, and still the same problem.

What I changed today is that I started running a breadboard power supply and I share the ground with the Arduino.  This seems to be the correct way to do it.  So I have a 5V supply on the board and I have the ground from the breadboard going to the Arduino and the sketch worked.

I was using digital read and pull_up resistor and that turns on the LED.  Pretty simple and that code is STILL RUNNING right now.

So the Arduino is working, it's running the sketch, I just can load a new sketch.

I checked the ""get board info"" and it reads the board and it's serial number, so the board is there, and it sees the board.
It was just working 1/2 hour ago, so I can't see it needing an update.  I don't have another computer to test it against and I don't have another board to test against this computer.  I do have a computer that sees the port, sees my iPhone on that port and reads the serial number from the Arduino on that port.  I do have an Arduino that is currently running the last loaded sketch and that sketch is working fine.

Q2: What else should I try?"

arduino,attaching/ detaching a servo mid code,"Problem-

I'm trying to detach a servo in the code of my project so that I can spin the servo and measure its angle using its potentiometer that I soldered onto. when I start the code it works fine and the board is either reading values from the ""detached"" servo's potentiometer or is moving the ""attached"" servo, depending on if the board is receiving a true/false signal from one of the pins. The problem is that no matter which state the board starts, it will not attach/detach the servo after I change the signal to the pin that's meant to switch its state. Everything else works fine though, the test messages sent into the serial port that  change for each state work fine while the code is running and the only problem that i can find, is that the board WILL NOT attach or detach my servo after it starts. i have absolutely no idea what im doing wrong.

hardware-

im using an arduino uno powered by a power supply and plugged into my computer. I have a MG995 servo motor also connected to a power supply with its signal pin connected to pin 9 on my board. i also soldered a wire onto the potentiometer of the servo and connected that to the A1 pin on my board. lastly, i connected the +5v on my board to pin 13 as a way of creating a true/false statement for the two states of my code.

if your wondering why i declared my servo mid code, i did it as a desperate attempt to fix the problem. it didn't help.

the point of the code is to move the servo arm, have the arduino record its movement, then mimic it after i change the state of the board.

please help, its late and im desperate."

arduino,need some help finding/understanding components for a project.,"So, I decided to take the plunge into arduino as a microcontroller for warhammer 40K mods I wanted to do. after buying an uno and playing around with it a little, I'm more or less confident enough in my programming/ability to find what I need software wise.

I'm running into some stumbling blocks, in regard to the power source, and remote.

the LED should be easy enough to power/control with a nano, and research has lead to believe that a   DFPlayer Mini Mp3 Player Board YX5200 Module will be sufficient for playing the sound effects I want(plane engines, and weapon fire).

but I'm really drawing a blank with the power supply, my plan was to buy a rechargable RC battery, but everything I can find seems to cap out at around 3.7V, which won't be enough to power the 5v output. I also don't want to go too high, since that seems like it'd require a buck converter and I'm concerned about running out of space in the model itself, since I'm already putting at the bare minimum an arduino nano, DF Player, power supply, charging module, and either RF or Bluetooth receiver within the model itself.

arduino,Loop Code But Still Listen for Bluetooth Commands,"I've been working on a little test project blinking LEDs to get the hang of using an HM10 with my Arduino Uno. My code (below) works in that sending a bluetooth command of 'b', 'i', or 'o' causes the LED to blink 3 times, turn on, or turn off respectively. However, I'm trying to write code where the LED will blink indefinitely yet still listen for another command and break that loop to do whatever the new command tells it to. For example, I would like to send 'b' via bluetooth and have the LED blink indefinitely, and then if I sent a command of 'o', the LED would turn off. I've been able to get the software to loop the blinking command and have the LED blink indefinitely with a 'b' command, but then the software does not respond to any other command I send it.

This is my first post here as I'm looking for a little help. I am building a project truck that I'm developing some of my own modules and PCBs for. This one here is a 3 button controlled thermostat, being 1 button increases target temp, 1 button decreases target temp and 1 button will have multiple functions based on timing input that will control fan speed and air vent direction.

What I'm looking for help for is having the control temperature function only when the current temperature drops or rises 2 degrees lower or higher than the target temperature, essentially just to keep from having the heat/AC turning on an off so frequently. So to explain a little more of what I'm looking for.  


**Example:**

**Target Temperature = 20\*C**  


**Current (Ambient) temperature drops to 18\*C = Turn Heat On**  


**Current (Ambient) temperature rises to 22\*C = Turn AC On**  


If someone could point me in the right direction how to go about this, I'd really appreciate it. I'm seasoned in Arduino coding but by no means am I considering myself a pro, so I still get brain twisted at some points."

All the information about using this driver relates to 3D printing, however I can't find any information to just run the board with a single stepper. 

Does anybody have any advice on where to go for more information regarding single wiring? Or maybe some things I am missing such as a firmware install I read about.

arduino,WiFi Serial Connection Help for Autonomous Squirrel Turret,"Good people of /r/Arduino: I come asking for help on setting up a means by which to pass GCode commands to an Arduino over WiFi via Python. The reason for this is, I have built a turret that uses machine learning to track squirrels at my birdfeeder and shoot them with a garden hose. That part is done, tested, and I'm fairly satisfied with it (except that the ML model needs more data, as always). Basically, it's a Reolink WiFi security camera mounted on a 2DOF gimbal with 2 stepper motors. A computer on the network with a decent GPU runs a Python script that fetches frames from the camera feed, uses OpenCV2 to detect squirrels in the image, and then sends GCode (currently over USB) to point the turret at the squirrel. Once it is within a designated section of the image, it sends a command to power up a solenoid that opens a valve and fires the garden hose at the squirrel. Once the squirrel has departed, the hose turns off and the system goes back to idling.

The problem with this, of course, is that I have to run a USB cable out to the turret to use it. Instead of being forced to do that, I wanted to attach a WiFi module to the Arduino board, and send the GCode commands through it. I purchased a D1 Mini Pro, which is a module based on the ESP8266 but supports 5V without an added regulator and has an attached antenna. I've connected that board to my PC via USB and tried flashing it with some test scripts via the Arduino IDE. So far I've been able to make it blink, and I've been able to get it to connect to my WiFi network, report its IP address, and answer a ping. That's where I am now.

What I want to do is wire the D1 Mini Pro to the RAMPS board (Tx,Rx,5V,G &gt; Rx,Tx,5V,G), and then be able to send GCode to the D1 Mini Pro and have it pass them through to the Arduino to execute them. Something really simple like just curling the commands to its IP address would be great, or if there's a Python module to interface with this in some kind of way. Just anything that can be done via a CLI. Ideally, it would be able to both send and receive, because I am going to have to put the Arduino in a sealed enclosure and would like to be able to query its temperature, but this is secondary to just being able to aim the thing.

Album attached, including current squirrel turret design and pictures of the boards being used: https://imgur.com/a/HkI4s37. I've promised that I would upload the code, parts list, and setup guide for Squirrel Turret once the project is ""finished"", and this is the last step. If I can get some help with this bit, you have my word that this sub will be the first to know."

arduino,"Looking at trying Arduino, is my project idea feasible?","I'm looking at making a project to make a gift for a friends birthday in a couple of months and i'm wondering if it is feasible in the timeframe i have and whether Arduino would be the best option or maybe a Raspberry Pi.

The basic idea is a clock which also displays a countdown to Halloween on an E-Ink display. From there I'm also looking at additional layers/goals where possible, depending on whether it is actually achievable both technically and in terms of the amount of time i have to learn and build.

* Push button for talking clock (recordings of my voice) reading out time, number of days etc)

It’s hard to find forums where I can ask questions for the PIC. I’m hoping since the arduino is tad bit similar to the PIC, I can find some assistance here. So, I am currently working on a project where I’m using a PIC18F45K22 to design a colour sensing/line following robot. I am at the end of the project where I have to make the robot able to navigate a course on it’s own, but for that, I need a portable power supply to power the curiosity board that my microcontroller is placed upon. I have a power bank that supplies 5V/1A out of it’s ports. However, when I use this power bank, my microcontroller bypasses all the initial states I have programmed into it (I use these states to calibrate my colour sensor for the different colours). The EUSART serial communication also doesn’t work when connected to the power bank. The board works perfectly when connected and powered by my PC. What could be the issue? I haven’t been able to go find much material regarding the power specifications of the the curiosity board. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

arduino,Will Tinkercad accurately determine a given capacitors effect? Can you use it to figure out which capacitor to use?,"Just started playing with tinkercad, looks pretty impressive. I was just wondering can you change the values of capacitors in order to see the effect in smoothing?

 I was thinking about an ignition control for a motorcycle, and it would need a cap, but I have no clue what size. If I were to play around with tinkercad maybe I could figure it out in there.

I saw one demo that used the oscilloscope in there, I should be able to do the same thing and change the cap around right?"

arduino,Mega 2560 won't acknowledge anything from computer,"So I have 2 Elegoo Mega2560 r3 boards, and simply put, neither of them acknowledges they've even been plugged into my computer. They will run the code on them, but I can't upload new code. While the Arduino IDE will connect to them both, when I press upload it will compile the code, try to upload, and then timeout. Neither TX nor RX light blinks when attempting to upload code. 

Any ideas? I've tried looking things up but couldn't find any solutions

arduino,Converting stepper motor commands into PWM dimming signals for LEDS,"Backstory, I stuck an LED engine in a moving head stage light. Originally the output brightness was altered by moving shutters in front of the lamp (powered by steppers). Would it be possible to write a code that would convert the stepper commands from the main motherboard into 16bit dimming commands for the LED driver? It would solve quite a few issues I am running into.

I probably also need a code that will write to console the values that the mainboard is spitting out to the steppers so Ik what to convert basically, help with that would also be appreciated.

Hope that all makes sense :)

arduino,"How to have a local var inside of loop, that doesn't reset?","So I see 3 sections, the global area, the setup function and the loop function.

I see this example code about scope:
    
    int gPWMval;  // any function will see this variable
    
    void setup() {
      // ...
    }
    
    void loop() {
      int i;    // ""i"" is only ""visible"" inside of ""loop""
      float f;  // ""f"" is only ""visible"" inside of ""loop""
      // ...
    
      for (int j = 0; j &lt; 100; j++) {
        // variable j can only be accessed inside the for-loop brackets
      }
    }

Question: how can I have a local var inside of loop() that doesn't get reset?

Example:
    
    int gPWMval;  // any function will see this variable
    
    void setup() {
      // ...
    }
    
    void loop() {

      int myLocalVar = 10;
      int i;    // ""i"" is only ""visible"" inside of ""loop""
      float f;  // ""f"" is only ""visible"" inside of ""loop""
      // ...

      myLocalVar++;
      if (myLocalVar &gt; 100) {
         myLocalVar = 10;
      }

      for (int j = 0; j &lt; 100; j++) {
        // variable j can only be accessed inside the for-loop brackets
      }
    }


So the problem is that myLocalVar would reset every time, so I would have to put it outside the loop and that makes it global.

Part of the reason it's like this is that the Arduino is designed as a controller and is always running.  So is there a way to have myLocalVar not be global and not reset.  Maybe declare it in setup and then pass it as a param to loop()?  Can you do that?"

arduino,Ardunio Uno Board Issues (beginner),"I purchased an Elegoo Arduino starter kit early this week. Today I was following a tutorial online for a togglable button. It was fairly easy and worked perfectly. I unplugged my Ardunio from my computer and returned a couple minutes later and plugged my Ardunio back in. However, this time it wasn't working.

 I unplugged my computer a couple of times but, the Arduino wasn't receiving any power nor was the computer registering that the Ardunio was plugged in. Then I tried the a battery that came with the kit that I had used before but that didn't work either. While it was still plugged into the computer I started to remove the wires going to the breadboard starting with the 5v pin. When I removed the wire from the Ardunio it was suddenly able to get power back. After a few tests the pin started to work again. However, when I connected to a simply LED with a 220 resistor the LED blew up. I unplugged the Ardunio and tried it again with a new LED and it didn't blow up. However, my troubles were far from over.

I wrote a simple ""blink"" program and it successfully was uploaded to the Arduino that used pin 13 just to test it. The LED that I had connected didn't light up nor did the onboard LED that pin 13 connects to lights up or any of the onboard LEDs expect for the green one. I tried all the pins and non of them worked but, the 5v pin still worked. 

I have no clue what could have happened so any advice at all is appreciated. Thank You!"

arduino,Help a newbie supercharge his smart garden,"Kind people of r/arduino, I could use your help with my gardening project since I'm still pretty green when it comes to Arduino.   


I've been using a pretty basic prebuilt kit that uses crowtail moisture sensors to turn on a water pump and open a corresponding relay (link #1). It has 3 expansion slots, and I'd like to add some additional functionality:

* A float valve to signal when water in my reservoir is low 
* A pH meter to measure to measure supplement buildup and track growth variables
* A wifi adapter to send readouts for logging

The first problem I'm having are figuring out what is compatible with my board (it seems like you can't just flash code from any crowtail to any board). Before understanding that, I purchased a few parts (note #2) and can't find much documentation on if these work with my board.   


The second problem, assuming that these add-ons are compatible, is how to go about adding their code to the INO. I assume the best way to go about it is to throw the sample codes together (with the include declarations at the top) and customize from there? I'm hoping my background in Python and JavaScript will help here.   


I know that there was a third, but I can't remember right now. I'll edit the post later if I think of it. If you're curious though, my plan is to have the wifi adapter spit out data (each plant's moisture, tank pH, and float 1/0) to an IP address, have my computer run a scheduled python script to mine the data into a CSV, and analyzing the output from there.   


Thanks so much for you help in advance!

arduino,Hooking up Arduino and WS2812b to car,"Hello fellow peeps.
Kinda long piece so please bear with me.


So. I got a pair of headlight that will turn my Camry into a little fake Lexus. Thing is, its ""DRL"" LED strip plugs into the side marker wire so the DRL basically works as a Nighttime Running Light, and the way the Camry works, highbeam and DRL runs on the same bulb.


So I want to cut all that bullshit and run my own true DRL switchback sequential strip (white light when the car is on, sequential amber flow when the arduino sense that signal light is blinking, and possibly half bright when lowbeam is on) that runs independently from the headlight system so even if it f up I still have all the original signal lights working for safety.


That means I have to hook up the WS2812b strip (5V, 16 LEDs/strip so around 800mA) and an Arduino directly to the battery/electrical system to have the Arduino always on, so like when I unlock my car the LED strip blinks with the signal light and when I leave my car and press lock button on my remote it blinks the same.


I heard of using voltage regulators, is it an optimal solution? Because I think the arduino's onboard regulator isn't good enough to do that and dispense too much heat. I think 5v is fine, initially I'll use my Uno but eventually when Fastled supports the Nano 33 BLE I'll replace the Uno with that one


Also, to sense the signal light's status, I'm thinking of using some optocoupler but I'm at lost on which one is good to wire into the 12v system (I plan to wire it parallel with signal light) or should I just tuck a photoresistor into the signal light compartment and call it done?"

arduino,Issues with serial communication on HM10 BLE device,"Hello, 
I've been stuck with a problem concerning my HM10 Bluetooth Module. I was able to establish a working serial connection with the AltSoftSerial library, AT commands work perfectly and the response time is very good.
When I connect with my smartphone to the HM10 device (using a ble scanner app), I can easily identify the custom service and the corresponding characteristic and write some text to it that is then also instantly visible in my serial monitor. 
Now the problem: The other way around does not work! When I send some text from my serial monitor, the read value of the characteristic does not change (as seen in the ble app). I can not seem to be able to wrap my head around this, since AT commands work just fine, when no smartphone is connected to the device.

Does anyone have some suggestions as to why the device behaves like this? 
I thought that the behaviour should be very similar to a normal serial interface when connected to a client? 

I'm using an Arduino Uno and a HM10 Bluetooth 4.0 BLE module. 

Attached, you can see the corresponding code, the wiring is also correct. The connection to the RX pin of the module happens though a voltage divider.

It required building a RGB LCD Shield, and the pcb design files were open hardware so I built it myself.

Now, the problem came when I tried to calibrate the PID values. I spent days trying to do so without any luck. So I decided to find some other code...

Then I found [this code](https://github.com/egiust/SousVideAdaptativeArduino) on github, and it looks like it's exactly what I need, it doesn't use PID! The only problem is that it uses an 8 digit led display, and I don't have it. I think I will order one but it will take months for it to arrive from China, as I can't get it locally.

I'm still learning how to code, so I don't know if what I'm asking is too difficult or if it would take a lot of time to make, but there's a slight chance that it's really a very simple thing to do and thought that maybe someone over here could help me out.

I don't really need it to use the RGB backlight functionality, as I mounted a regular negative 16x2 character display with a single white led as a backlight.

I don't need to use every button on the shield. Looks like the original code only has 2 buttons, so I could use 2 buttons from my shield. There's no need to add extra functionalities to the code, I can leave the rest of the buttons on the shield functionless.

There we're a lot that gave me tips but some tips I did not not understand/still studying atm but I think this design works already though does not have failsafes.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from anything I may not know is wrong from my design, here are a few questions I have:

1. Do I need C9? I had a previous design that used a relay instead of a mosfet. There was no optocoupler between gnd and the transistor so when the relay/pump shuts off, a noise signal (my assumption) is sent to D2 (my interrupt pin) and triggers it. The problem was solved by a capacitor in D2. Now with a mosfet driving the pump, do i still need an optocoupler or C9 or im good without both?
2. I did not know placing traces was so hard (probably because im a newbie) so do you guys think the widths and paths are ok? note: Coin acceptor eats up \~65mA (according to the data sheet) and pump is 12v @ 3A.

and here are the diagram and pcb layout (i did not put the copper layer for the grounds so the traces are clear.

arduino,GPS tracker that tells you when you are beyond the boundaries of a map,"Hi, a few months ago I came here to ask about a responsive airsoft vest that rings when being hit with BB pellets. Thanks a lot cuz I got very positive responses!

My second question is, is it possible to create with arduino a wearable device that works like this.

* A device is worn on someone's arm
* That device works like a GPS tracker, where it tracks a person's location and display it on a map on an app real time.
* When there are several people wearing the device, it displays the location of all the people who are wearing the device (around 50 people). So when a person moves, the 'point' on the map moves along, like this photo.

* Apart from that, a shrinking circle is displayed on the map (like battle royale games). Over time, the circle shrinks.
* If a person's location is outside the circle, it lights up an LED on the person's device, or sends a message to the app, like 'Player A is outside the circle'."
arduino,Can't upload sketches to a fresh ATmega328P,"I took a fresh DIP28 328P and burned a bootloader (Optiboot) using my Arduino UNO clone as ISP.  Avrdude reported no problem. But I can't upload sketches through my USB-UART adapter – IDE always reports ""programmer not responding"".

What I've already tried:
– Switch from Optiboot to MiniCore.
– Change USB-UART adapter (although I know both my adapters are functional, that same day I used them to upload sketches to Atmega8 chip).
– Add pull-up resistor between RST (pin 1) and  VCC.
– Add cap between GND and VCC (pins 7 and 8).
– Add cap between adapter's DTR pin and IC's RST (pin 1).
– Just for a test, I uploaded Blink directly through SPI. Sketches worked, LED blinked. Later I burned a bootloader again, to no positive effect.

Crystal oscillator, 16 MHz, is in place, accompamied by 22 pF caps.

Where else should I search for a problem source? I'm going to re-burn this 328P tonight using USBasp, but I'm not sure it's gonna help."

arduino,[RTL8722CSM/RTL8722DM] TensorFlow Lite - Hello World," 

Introduction to Google TensorFlow

TensorFlow (TF) is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

While TensorFlow Lite (TFL) for Microcontrollers is designed to run machine learning models on microcontrollers and other devices with only a few kilobytes of memory. The core runtime just fits in 16 KB on an Arm Cortex M3 and can run many basic models. It doesn't require operating system support, any standard C or C++ libraries, or dynamic memory allocation.

Ameba and TensorFlow Lite TFL

Ameba is an easy-to-program platform for developing all kinds of IoT applications. AmebaD is equipped with various peripheral interfaces, including WiFi, GPIO INT, I2C, UART, SPI, PWM, ADC. Through these interfaces, AmebaD can connect with electronic components such as LED, switches, manometer, hygrometer, PM2.5 dust sensors, …etc.

Hello World Example Running on Ameba RTL8722DM

The materials we are going to prepare only requires:

* 1 x Ameba D RTL8722DM or RTL8722DM-mini, and
* 1 x LED.

Example Guide  
Download the Ameba customized version of TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers library at ambiot/ambd\_arduino.  
Follow the instructions at Arduino - Libraries to install it.  
Ensure that the patch files found at ambiot/ambd\_arduino are also installed.  
Open the example, “Files” -&gt; “Examples” -&gt; “TensorFlowLite\_Ameba” -&gt; “hello\_world”.

Upload the code and press the reset button on Ameba once the upload is finished.  
Connect the LED to digital pin 10 and ground, ensuring that the polarity is correct. You should see the LED fade in and out rapidly.  
In the Arduino serial plotter, you can see the output value of the Tensorflow model plotted as a graph, it should resemble a sine wave.

You can train your model with google collab by following this weblink:

The plan was to use 2 pins per switch (plus ground.) I'm wondering if there is a way to use one pin per switch and some resistors? 

I was thinking I could switch to an external pull down resistor and then wire one state of the switch to an analog pin, then wire the other on state of the switch to the same pin, but through a resistor. Then by reading the value I could tell in which way the switch was flipped. 

Will this method work reliably? and if so how do I know what resistor value to use?"

arduino,Can you power up a 4 wire 12v Bosch motor manually even with hall sensors?,"Hey everyone!

So I’ve asked around quite a bit still haven’t gotten a good answer yet. 

Hoping the arduino boys have the solution!

So I have a 2018 model s Tesla seat front drivers side. It’s a power seat with a bunch of different 12v Bosch motors used to adjust the seat. I have the seat, not the actual vehicle. I’m attempting to quickly power up one of the motors, basically hotwiring it to adjust it back about an inch. The only question o have is how to do this with a 4 wire motor, that has hall sensors. I have the schematic from Tesla. It shows one wire is for the tilt forward, one is for tilt back, one is a ground wire, the other goes to a hall sensor built into the msm memory module or perhaps even the bcm. So my question is how can I bypass that hall sensor or find a way to trick it into thinking there is a hall sensor?  Is it even necessary to power up the motor?  Again I just need to adjust the seat back a few inches and it will be all good to go. I have a 12v lawnmower battery I’ve been using to try and Hotwire the motors but they don’t seem to respond with power at all. Guessing it has something to do with the hall sensor.


Any advice would be so greatly appreciated!"

arduino,14-Segment LCD or AMOLED (quasi) display question ;)," Hello, folks. I am a programmer so I have some marginal technical experience towards what I'm wanting to do but am needing some guidance from dudes who really know their Arduino stuff -- if that is, in fact, the direction I should take this ;) ..

Essentially I have a very small PC, and we'll have a standard display on one of the HDMI outputs running a Flash game I wrote (yes, yes, I know, Flash has been deprecated, it's antiquated, no longer supported, all that -- but it's for a self-contained standalone machine and it works :D) and basically words are displayed or text animations are run by the touch of a button. All that's dandy. The electronic components part comes here:

Let's say I have 12 separate (identical) mini-displays about the thinness and size of a business card or smaller whose purpose is to simply display up to four characters (could be 14-segment LCD characters or possibly cool AMOLED-style paper-thin ""screens"", doesn't matter) on command. For example, user hits ""8"" on the keyboard. My Flash's key-listerner already responds appropriately and displays something Flashy programmed to the hit of the ""8"", but at the same time, the 8th display module lights up ""HI"" (and maybe the 7th display module lights up ""BYE""). I know JavaScript and several web languages, but I can't piece together in my head how I could add this extra ""display"" element -- I've looked into Raspberry PI, Arduino, and am actually willing to learn C# if I have to.. but I can't quite figure out the best pieces and tech to make this type of thing happen. Anyone have any wisdom on this, I would be delighted and forever grateful ;)"

arduino,Getting faster input reads from Arduino?,"**[UPDATE] Problem solved, changed the baud rate in the program to 115200 and matched it in the plotter window.  Works MUCH better now.
**
-----------------------------

I'm using the serial plotter to display the reads from a simple loop the reads voltage.

Simple voltage reader using two resistors, reads inside of a loop and prints the output.  I set the delay to 30, then removed the delay and it didn't seem to speed up.

I'm thinking that the delay is in the software displaying the graph.

I'm hooking this up to an engine coil and cranking the engine (not starting, just cranking).  It shows the variation of the voltage to the coils to see where it drops.  It doesn't seem to be fast enough, but that could be because of the software.

Q1. how fast does a simple loop with no delay(), read the input?

Q2. Is there enough memory on a Mega2560 to store an array of data from a loop for maybe 1 min or 30 seconds?

Q3. is there a faster way to take sample readings?

    void loop(){
       // read the value at analog input
       value = analogRead(analogPin);
       vout = (value * 5.0) / 1024.0;

The main things I'm looking for it to do is control LEDs to get different effects; blinking, pulsing, steady, etc(sometimes different effects in the same model). control sound effects, and control some small motors - nothing too crazy with the motors, mostly I'd like to take a knight; \[one of these\]([https://www.games-workshop.com/resources/catalog/product/920x950/99120108005\_IMPERIALKNIGHTCRUSADER01.jpg](https://www.games-workshop.com/resources/catalog/product/920x950/99120108005_IMPERIALKNIGHTCRUSADER01.jpg)) for anyone who doesn't know and make it rotate at the hips, and have the Gatling gun spin.

&amp;#x200B;

preferably, I'd like the sound chip and and gatling gun to be controllable with either a remote control, or just separate physical switches so the entire system isn't a binary ""off/on"".

So, is Arduino the right choice for those kinds of projects, or do I need to look somewhere else?"

arduino,Best micro sd card breakout board,I need a micro sd card breakout board for a project. I am using adafruit to order all of the necessary parts for this project and they have 2 micro sd card breakout boards. [Option 1](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4682) which costs $3 or [Option 2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/254) which costs $7.5. They both use SPI and the only difference I see from a usable perspective is one takes 3.3v and the other 5v. I don't mind spending an extra $3 but I just want to know what is  better on the more expensive card. Anyone have experience with any of these card? Which one did you get?

arduino,Issue with Serial Communication?,"Hey y'all, I'm using an Arduino UNO as a ""middle man"" of sorts between some fancy Brushless servos (Teknic ClearPath!) and LabView running on a PC. I already have all of the motion control stuff sorted out, but I am encountering an issue with serial communication. Essentially, my Arduino will only accept a string  (what I'm using as a command of sorts) over serial only every other activation of my code. When it works, the internal LED (pin 13) is solid, and the RX and TX LEDs act as normal. However, as seen in the video in the Imgur album, the second time when it receives a string over Serial the pin13 LED blinks, turns off briefly, then back on again. Also included a screenshot of my Arduino and LabView code. Anyone have any Idea what's going on?

arduino,Slow Commands with Arduino Due and Matlab?,"I am working on a project that relies on an Arduino Due as a go-between for some SPI devices. Unfortunately the designers are relying on Matlab to do everything else.

I have timed the Matlab code and noticed that the commands to the Arduino itself (digitalWrites, etc) are very slow. For example, a single digitalWrite takes 1.6ms. I believe this is because the default baud rate for the serial-USB is capped at 115200. The system has a significant number of devices, so this 1.6ms adds up very quickly!

The Due supports much higher rates when using its native USB port. This port can be used for receiving serial commands from the host PC in the Arduino IDE by having your program call SerialUSB.write() instead of Serial.write(). Unfortunately, Matlab's implementation of the Arduino commands is not very straightforward (at least to me).

Is there any way to do this with Matlab? i.e. can you use the native port instead of the standard USB serial port? Additionally, am I correct in thinking that the baud rate is the issue?"

The data is saved properly to the file. I've checked the board connnection to LAN, the board responds to `ping`.

But when I try to run the complete code, with both sections(server, sd card) it tries to run for a few seconds and then just hangs. No errors are displayed and the board responds to a ping indicating an active connection.

My wiring for DHT11 is slightly different: the green wire in connected to pin 7 and red wire is connected to 3.3V pin.

I've included the photographs of the setup [here](https://imgur.com/a/N4vmmJY).

arduino,Arduino and esp01 serial communication,"Hi, i want to send the simple string ""S1"" or ""S2"" or ""S3"" or ""S4"" from atmega328p to esp01.  When esp01 is powered up the first thing he has to do is read the string send by the atmega328p and reply to him with: if ""S1"" replies with ""S2"", if ""S2"" replies with ""S3"" and so on .. I have initialized both serial at 9600 baud rate (Software serial on pins 10,11). 

What can be the pseudo code for the atmega328p sketch and the esp01 sketch that really works?  

I tried various ways but the read string seems dirty or for other reasons including the voltage with which I feed esp01 seems not to make the reading from the serial work correctly. For this reason, before moving on to check the hardware, I would like to be sure that at least on the software side everything works. 
Thank you"
arduino,Digital Servo Selection," Dear All,

I am a new dabbler in the RC world and would kindly be open to advice about a servo selection im trying to make. My application requires a fast response, high holding power servo with a stall torque near 3kg.cm. As such, I was advised to select digital servos. I noticed a huge price difference between two digital servos of similar specifications. The 1st is seen in the link : [https://www.alibaba.com/product-deta...172399199.html](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Corona-DS319MG-cheap-high-torque-electric_62172399199.html) which is roughly R135 in my south african currency. The latter is a Hitech digital servo : [https://www.aerialconcepts.co.za/cgi...v%20mini%20dig](https://www.aerialconcepts.co.za/cgi-bin/aerialconcepts/search.pl?id:RHS7235MH:Servo%20hitec%206v3.6/7.4v4.4kg%20hv%20mini%20dig) . From what I've heard, brands like Hitech, Futaba and Savox have a good reputation and I would assume that R934 servo price is due to that in the 2nd link. However, I am unfamiliar with Corona type servos; I'm not sure if they are reliable given the significantly cheaper price. I would appreciate any advice in this regard.

Kind Regards"

arduino,16x2 LCD I2C not working with BMP280 sensor,[deleted]
arduino,Need help with powering a keyboard with 105 SK6812Mini-E Programmable RGB LEDs Using Arduino.,"You may recall my project that i posted like a week or so ago, The 16 keys Macro Keyboard. Now, i want to scale this to a full keyboard and make a pcb for it (because i've hand wired everything and it is a total mess).

I've just started with learning electronics like 2 weeks ago (literally, this was my first project) and all i can say is that there are huge gaps in my knowledge regarding powering things over Arduino or similar boards (and many other things, but for now this is my main concern).  My main problem is powering a 100% keyboard with per-key lights, using the SK6812Mini-E LEDs (40mAh/LED max). From what i've read online, the pro micro/ elite C can only output a maximum of 500mAh. I've used a Marvo keyboard that looks like it uses the ws2812B Mini leds (or something that looks like it) and on the back of it it says that it uses a max of 300mAh of Working Current. How is this possible? Am i missing something? It May be that at ""maximum"" brightness, the LEDs are not really at their full capacity? To me it seems like these leds are super bright, even tho it consumes so little power. Still, there are a lot of LEDs to drive.

Any advice, information or anything helpful will be kindly appreciated. Sorry if the question sounds stupid or if the problem ins't clear enough. My english is kinds rusty. I really wanna learn more but I don't know where to start managing this problem. I feel like I've searched the entire internet and still nothing lol.

I knew I would have to calibrate the sensors and they are showing that they are off to some degree. Varying per roaster. Actual temp range is 70 deg F to 500 deg F. 500 being a preheat for the roasters.

When going through Adafruit’s customer service forums they say that all I need to do is a simple 2 point calibration. Is that advisable? Has anyone here also used these and calibrated in the same manner?

All other TCs amps/read outs that I have calibrated have all been a multi step process/endeavor. 

I wanted to make sure I could get away with doing a simple 2 point calibration instead of the normal many step TC calibration.

If I upload something without the shield, everything works. If I put the shield on after something has been uploaded and power on, Serial monitor doesnt show anything, even though everything worked without the shield. The power led turns on the shield and sometimes the SPI led is red for a while. Not sure if this is related to the program uploaded on the board or not.

So that leads me to believe I have messed up when I soldered the headers. My soldering is ""a bit"" rusty, but using some flux I got decent results imo.

Here is a pictures from the soldering, if anyone has some insight that something is wrong with it:

This side was first soldered without flux and then again with flux:

arduino,"Will this project work, read the input and output of an ignition timing (CDI) box using Arduino?","I want to use my Arduino to read the resistance change from a hall-effect pickup that feeds to a CDI box.  I found a project for that:

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/iasonas-christoulakis/how-to-make-an-arduino-ohm-meter-90fda8

Seems pretty straight forward.

The next part would be to read the voltage over time on the output of the CDI/Ignition box that feeds the primary (12VDC) side of the coils.

This shows how a coil works, seems pretty straight forward, it supplies 12V to a coil, the removes it.  When it's removed a spark is generated on the secondary side.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWyn_eV-DzM

So, best I can figure, it supplies 12V all the time, until it wants a spark, then it removes the current for a period of time.

I just need to verify the input and the output so that I can test the ignition box to see if it's triggering the coil and if it's getting the input.

I would have to read this at a certain speed range (sampling rate) and I have no idea what that is, but I can make it a variable that I can change interactively (I hope).

I wouldn't be reading the secondary side because the voltage is far too high and I have a light made for that.

I have no idea how fast an Arduino can poll a feed, it's the Mega 256 if that matters and I'm thinking of a pretty simple loop that would just poll and display 3 feeds, 1 input, 2 outputs and then check for up/down adjustments for scale.

This would be use to test an ignition box at first, then maybe later an engine control box.  It doesn't have to be fast enough for higher RPM work, as I can move over to a faster chip setup later if I need to, this would just be a prototype.

Update the first part of this reading the resistance it's bouncing all over the place I don't know if I need to smooth it or if I hook something up wrong is there anyway to get a smooth reading?"

arduino,No response from my analog output pin.,"I just got an arduino.  I had no issue with using the digital pins, but I can't get the analog output to work.  I ran this code:

    void setup() {

      pinMode(A0, OUTPUT);
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
      analogWrite(A0, 128);
      delay(1000);
      analogWrite(A0, 0);
      delay(1000);
    }

I can't detect a voltage with a multimeter.  The pin I'm calling A0 has DAC0 printed on the module, but that gives me an error in the arduino IDE.  

And then how do I use that I/O module?  The documentation says what functions it has, but"

arduino,Is the Arduino Uno fast enough to calculate high speeds?,I'm interested in building a chronograph using the Arduino. I'm really new to this so pardon my ignorance. My idea is to use two LEDs and two sensors. I'm aiming it to be able to detect up to 280 m/s. I've been reading that a popular function used is the micros() one and that has a resolution of four microseconds. Is that enough to calculate the speed? I'm quite at a lost in interpreting that tidbit.

arduino,Need recommendation: Keychain sized arduino with wireless receiver,"I need some hardware recommendations for an arduino project. I need a pair of arduinos which communicate one-way wirelessly. If possible, the receiving arduino should be small enough to carry on a keychain along with the receiver chip, battery, and a small alarm speaker.

The only requirement for the transmitting arduino is that it works with the matching transmitter chip. The arduino itself doesn't have to be small.

Edit: I'm looking for something short range that doesn't need WiFi to communicate. The two components will usually be 10 ft. or less apart. I'm hoping to find something that will drop communication when the keychain moves 50 ft or so away from the transmitter."

I'm a JavaScript/PHP developer who has never used Arduino before willing to help a friend of mine with his business while learning something fun.

He has a small courier company and he need to track his trucks. I googled about it and I found out that is quite easy to connect a SIM and make a program where you can send a sms to the device and get the coords back as a sms response, but what I want to do is to periodically post these coords to an internet endpoint using the internet provided by the SIM connected to the Arduino. I asume this is possible and straightforward with the help of GSM Web Client.

Now I'm wondering what would be the cheapest hardware approach to achieve this, I saw that there are ""Arduino Nano"" which are very cheap, but I don't have a clue if those are enough. I'm open to any suggestions to achieve it, which modules to use, software tutorials or anything."

arduino,One button one mode.,"Hi

I am working on a school project. I am pretty new to arduino. I want to make an automatic wiper system. I am using a raindrop sensor to detect the amount of rain and then a servo motor. What I want to do now is add some modes. Similar as one would find in a car. eg. LOW speed, HIGH speed, OFF, AUTO mode. I have already configured the automatic mode.

What I want to do is add buttons. I want to detect which button was pressed and than accordingly run the desired mode assigned to that button. The program should run in that mode until another button is pressed. It should then run the new desired mode (assigned to the now pressed button.)

Of course I want the button to be pressed and then released.

How could one achieve that? I could use a switch case (would also be my first time). But I think that my main question is how to store the value (# of the button) to than use in the switch case. And than use this button until I click another button"

arduino,LEDs started bright but went dim,"Hello everyone. New to arduino and learning with my niece. We are following along with a basic YouTube tutorial and ran into something I dont understand and can't explain to her, or seem to fix. 

We started with a basic program to turn an LED connected to a breadboard on and off. It worked for about an hour and then the LEDs got really dim. It still works and they are lighting up but very dim. What could the reason be for this. We didn't change anything but the timings for the one and off delays. 

It's an arduino uno. We are using pin 8 (don't think that matters) and we did pinMode(8,OUTPUT). Pin8 -&gt; 330 ohm -&gt; LEDs -&gt; GND. We have it connected directly to my laptop. Like I said worked nice and bright for about an hour then went dim. If we change LEDs they are also very dim. 

Sorry if it's a real noob question but I didn't get any help searching. LED and dim seems to get a lot of hits for the LEDs on the arduino being dim."

I've come up with a couple of ideas of how to do this. The gates you drive through I believe just send an open close signal down two wires to the Chronoprinter which measures the time it took to drive between each gate.

The two ways I've thought of are:

An Arduino at either end, clocks sync'd and simply records the time each gate is passed through and times can be compared.
Issue with this is syncing times seems to be difficult, whether it syncs via GPS or needs a crystal timer or something. We need 100th millisecond eg 5.123 seconds

The second idea is somehow sending the signal from one to the other via wireless, not sure via 433hz, 2.5ghz, UHF, radio, gsm?
The issue I have with this is I'm not sure the latency we'd need to build in to the time and how accurate that could be?

Any ideas?"

Hi!

I intend to connect two Arduinos (two UNOs) via I2C. When searching the connections that should be made, I found two versions: one said that you should simply connect each pin to its correspondent on the other board (5V to 5V, GND to GND, SDA to SDA, SCL to SCL); the other said that you should also connect one pull-up resistor between 5V and SDA and another pull-up between 5V and SCL.

Which is the correct way to do it?

Thank you"
arduino,Bummer. FastLed.h and Bluetooth,"In another post I was complaining that the messages being received from my HC05 were sometimes garbage. Using the Google (George Bush said it this way), I found a reply to someone experiencing the same issues that FastLed manages interrupts and resultingly, that will screw with SoftwareSerial trying to receive data. Certainly makes sense, especially since a test program I wrote, that does \*not\* use FastLed.h, works reliably.

So... is there a solution to this mess? I'm using an UNO because I'm retrofitting an existing project . The UNO is in a custom case and is mounted to the wall in our screened porch. In order to use a board with more than one hardware UART will be a major rework. If I have to, I have to. Would I have the same issues with a board that has Bluetooth built-in, such as a ESP32? Or do I need to use a Mega?"

arduino,How do you invert data?,"So I'm using a controller to control 2 servo motors, similar to Michael reeves 2 part video on making a laser turret. I am using an arduino uno to run this, even though it isn't totally necessary. The laser diode gets the uno 3.3v, and the receiver gets the 5v. I originally had the receiver channels go straight to the laser to control it, but the way I've set it up means the controls are inverted - pushing up on the controller points the laser down etc.

I think I could fix this by sending the receiver signals to the uno first, inverting it, and sending it to the servos but I don't know how to do that. 

Is there a function that can just 'invert' a signal that?

Als I think I'd have to convert it to angles so I can pass back out to the servo

So like:

Initialise all the variables

Void setup
{
Attach the servos 
}

Void loop 
{
Get input from the receiver channels 
Convert them to degrees (0-180)
Invert them, making high values low and low ones high
Move the servos 
}

arduino,Controlling a servo through Serial connection,"Hi there!

I'm making a 3d printed attitude meter to display attitude info of my plane in the game DCS: World.

Here is my code:

    #include &lt;Servo.h&gt;
     
    Servo servoBank;
    char val;
    int bank;
     
    void setup() {
      servoBank.attach(3);
      Serial.begin(9600);
      servoBank.write(95);
    }
     
    void loop() {
      if (Serial.available()){
        val = Serial.read();
        Serial.write(val);
        servoBank.write(val);
        delay(300);
      }
    }

If I write to my SG90 servo, the servo works perfectly fine. It turns well and precisely. However, when the data is sent through a Serial connection from my C# application to the Arduino Uno (CH340), it twitches and stays pretty much at one angle.   
I know the data is correctly sent from the C# application to the Arduino, because when it's sent back from the Arduino to the C# Console window, it displays the correct number.

arduino,Need help winning a ceiling fan battle with my neighbors.,"Ok. Ive always wanted to dive into arduino but i've never identified a useful enough application until now. I understand basic programming concepts but not much else. But ive got a little war going on. Im committed to learning. Id just like a little help moving in the right direction. 

My neighbors have the same ceiling fan as I do. I have no idea who they are and I had my ceiling fan first. The remotes on these things work 2 blocks away! Ive tested it. In my house, I have a big vaulted ceiling. Without the fan on full blast, the upstairs is boiling and the downstairs is an icebox. The ac never shuts off. So basically every day is a constant battle for control of the ceiling fan. They want it off, and I need it on. We've tried for months to force them to give up, but they won't. I need to step up my game.

Feel free to tell me if I am on the wrong track. But here is my plan. Id like to get an arduino set up to constantly enforce my control over the fan and the light. I imagine it interacting with my remote. Like every 30 seconds it sends a command to keep the fan on full power. And maybe a sensor up by the actual light that senses when it is off or on. And a toggle on the remote unit that we can set one way or the other.

Is this feasible? What are my first steps? 

Thanks in advance!"
arduino,LED controls/LED backpacks/Alternatives to Uno?,"Hey folks!

I'll start off by saying I'm not very good when it comes to understanding the hardware side of electronics- plus, I've had five or so years away from the maker scene so apologies in advance if these questions seem a little basic!

So, I make custom costumes for furries, and a commission I recently accepted needs LEDs in the headpiece. Initially I thought it'd be simple but it's slowly become a little more than my current skillset is at. ^^' I'm following a tutorial by a content creator called Mugiwara Cosplay, and it's a great starting point! However, I still have a few questions.

One of the aspects of the costume is to have different animations play across the LEDs when either the thumb and a finger touch or when a button is pushed in the fingertip of the costume's glove. I'm not sure as to how to go about it, but I'm taking a lot of inspiration from another costume (called Dr. Wildlife) on this aspect of the suit's LED animations changing.

Another part I'm having trouble with is sourcing the hardware parts themselves, and knowing what to get. For the headpiece, I know I need four 8x8 1.2"" LED  matrices, two 16x8 1.2"" matrices, and two EL panels. I'm having trouble finding the 16x8 LEDs with included backpacks, so can I buy the backpacks separately? What do they even do? Do I need anything other than the Arduino, the in-glove controllers, a power source, and the parts above to make it work?

Finally, the tutorial says to use an Arduino Nano or Uno. Neither of those are really on the market anymore, so do any of you have any suggestions on what would be able to work in its stead?

Thanks!"

I have an HM-11 BT module that I am configuring as a Master/Central and attempting to connecting to a SH-M08 BT slave module.
I can connect to the slave successfully but I cant send data.

From the monitor I can send AT+CON[ADDR] and get back OK+CONNA and OK+CONN which indicates that connection was successful.
When I attempt to send anything via the serial connection it does not get received by the slave BY. I am able to used my phone to send data to the slave BT.

arduino,Mp3 Shuffle Function,"Hi.

Using [DfPlayer mini](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299) and [this](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/DFPlayerMini_Fast) library I've managed to make a basic MP3 player with an arduino communicating with it using serial.

The problem I have is that it doesn't have a shuffle function, it only has a random function which leads to frequent repeats and also doesn't contain itself to one folder. It ""randoms"" the entire sd card or nothing.

My idea so far:

\- Get number of tracks in folder.  
\- Load array using for loop where 1st song is in index 0  
\- Shuffle array.  
\- Play array.

The way my code works is that I continuously check for input in the main loop and then handle that input using functions. So in order not to stop this, I need to have a step in the loop check if the shuffle the player is ""set"" to shuffle play, then play the next index of the array when it stops playing.

I did try to code this (IMO really garbage code that I have no idea if is even sensible) and find a array randomiser using google, but suffice to say it didn't work at all. I really don't like arrays and I am struggling with this, could someone help?

I'm obviously happy to use simpler methods, but whatever the solution it has to be handled on the Arduino and play the next song in the way I described above.

Hope I've added what is needed, but if not let me know."

arduino,Stupid beginner question: controlling motors with an arduino.,"How would one go about using the 5v IO output of the arduino to control a motor, which is probably 12v or 24v, obviously much more power than the arduino can supply directly, even to a single motor? I know that you can use the 5v output to open and close a relay to turn the 12 or 24 volt power on and off, but I want to be able to use the 5v PWM to control the motor speed at any moment, not just an all-or-nothing on/off switch with a fixed set speed."

arduino,WS2812 from USB Battery Pack,"Follow up question to my one a few hours ago

If I was to get a few 10AH USB battery packs (the ones used to charge your phones)   
and put them in parallel (to double the amp output)   
could I run a LED strip from them?

They are smaller and lighter then the SLA battery I had planned and tested on using,   
with a higher capacity rating   
just a lower amp output (2amp per socket)

so if I got 3, all hooked up, thats 6 amps theoretical max   
More then enough for what im pulling,   
(measured 4 amp peak bursts)   
and 30AH total would give me a decent runtime  

Is there anything wrong with this plan?"
arduino,Need help with project ideas - all suggestions welcome!,"Hey guys,
Me and a friend of mine are trying to think of ideas for our final year project.
We’re no experts, but we do have a combined good background in coding, electronics, woodworking, metalworking, CAD.
Bonus points if the project helps people in any way. Awesomeness is necessary. We would love to hear any and all suggestions you might have.

P.S the reason I’m posting this here is because the project must contain a microcontroller, which will most likely be an Arduino (although we might use a raspberry pi if we need something like a camera)."

arduino,Making an Automatic Squirrel Feeder,"Hey Folks! Before you read this, I have no clue about coding or anything arduino, so this post may be a little painful for you :)

I recently saw Mark Rober's squirrel parkour video (the first one), where he also built this cute picnic table with a flap that opens at the same time every day. I wanted to remake this, but apart from the woodworking, which should be fine, I have no clue how to program this, or what other parts I need to make this flap work, and open at the same time each day. So first of all, is it possible to pull this off with an arduino? If so, what do you think I will need in terms of hardware? There are a ton of boards, and I have no clue which one would be best. Also, do I need some sort of ""clock module"" for this to work? I have a friend who can help me code, but I would really appreciate some aid on what parts I need, and how they are connected. I probably need wires and a battery as well, right? Sorry again, for my absolute lack of knowledge regarding everything arduino. But well, everyone has to start somewhere :) 

Thanks in advance!

arduino,Battery for WS2812 Strip? (Something's not right),"Hi all  
I have posted this in a few places, so sorry if you have seen it somewhere else  
Im working on a battery powered led strip project, iv put the project together and have been testing with a mains power supply  
Iv run some tests and found at max I'd be pulling 4.5 amps   
Averaging around 2 ish

I rounded out to about 3.5 amps, and said for 90 mins run time id be looking at the 7ah battery  
7/2 = 3.5 so 2 hours runtime 

I got a 7ah SLA 12v battery, running though a 12v to 5v converter to power the led strips   
(Arduino is running off a usb battery pack)

However after about 45 mins I tested the battery and it said 10.9 v  
Which I understand to be too low for SLA batteries (11 should be the minimum?) so I shut it off

My question is did I mess up somewhere and get my math wrong?

Many thanks in advance"

arduino,Trying to store and read individual bits into an integer. So close. What am I doing wrong?,"For my project, I am saving thousands of values to EEPROM memory. In order to fit all of the values into the EEPROM's capacity, I have to crunch all of my smaller values (anything from true/false to 1 - 8) into larger data types.

Storing bits into a bit field has been successful, however I have decided to attempt to fit individual bits inside of a single integer, since I it would be incredibly laborious to write out all of the individual names of the values inside of the struct to be assigned to each switch. Not only are there dozens of switches, but each switch represents a different 'page' of the controller all with their own values.

Right now I'm starting with true/false bits only. I'm trying to write the value to the integer ""bitsInFRAM"" and print it to binary to see that the values match up. When the integer ""bitsInFRAM"" prints binary, it is shifted one bit over. I've tried omitting the final shift, but it does not work.

arduino,Water level sensor suggestions,"I did a [writeup a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydroponics/comments/mgrmwk/esponics_my_attempt_at_automating_hydroponic/) regarding my hydroponic project. Overall, it's been pretty great.

I am having problems with my water level sensor and I want to see if any r/arduino readers have any suggestions. Currently I am using the [eTape](https://milonetech.com/products/standard-etape-assembly) sensor -- it's not that great. My nutrient solution is causing salts to build up on the sensor, leading to incorrect readings and requiring the sensor to be cleaned.

For v2, I am thinking about maybe using a ball float connected to some sort of [stretch sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/519), but I am wondering if you all know about a product already out there that doesn't require as much creative effort on my part.

The sensor has to be waterproof and needs to measure volume, so ultrasonic sensors or simple float switches aren't really an option.

arduino,DHT11 anomaly (maybe),"I built an IoT temperature and humidity sensor for our screened-in porch (a lanai as we say in Florida). I've had the Huzzah32 (ESP32) board and the DHT11 just hanging by the USB connector during prolonged testing and the temp and humidity kind of matched the results from another commercial unit whose sensor is also on the porch.

I bought some small black plastic boxes from Hammond and finally got around to mounting the ESP32 in the box with the DHT11mounted on top on the outside of the box. I also drilled large holes in the sides of the box for airflow, since the ESP32 gets warm during normal operation.

Fastforward a little: The temperature is now reading about 10 degrees F higher than the commercial unit. &lt;stoopid question&gt; Since the DHT11 is mounted flush (there's a 1mm gap maybe) to the top of the box, am I reading the elevated temperature of the box due to the heat of the ESP32? Or am I reading stored heat in the box and sensor because I did the box fabrication in the garage where the temperature was much higher than the outside?

I'll let it run for a day and see if it settles out. If not, do I have to add a 'fudge' factor to the data payload sent to MQTT to downgrade the temp reading? Or... would a different sensor be better (a DHT22 perhaps?)? Same problem would exist because the new sensor would be mounted flush as well.

Or (again)... should I remove the screws from the DHT11 and let it hang by the 3-pin JST cable?"

arduino,Makeshift method for using an external clock/debugger,"So as we all know, the arduino sadly does not include a debugger and correctly using an external oscillator basically means not using an arduino anymore.

Since this is going to be used for debugging purposes, the 'clock' used will either be very slow or manually triggered. For reference the clock i'm referring to is the one built by Ben Eater.

I thought i would take the input of the clock and set it as interrupt on pin 2 on Uno. And after having the written the code, i insert a bit to wait until the interrupt function is called to let it move on.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first stab at it, it doesn't work on tinker cad, i'm a bit lazy so i haven't built the circuit. I decided to use blinking LED for a classic callback.

&amp;#x200B;

Original Code:

    void setup()
    {
      pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
    }
    
    void loop()
    {
      digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
      delay(1000);
      
      digitalWrite(13, LOW);
      delay(1000);
    }

My attempt at external clock:

    // C++ code
    //
    
    const byte interrupt_pin = 2;
    volatile byte move_on = LOW;
    
    void setup()
    {
      pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(interrupt_pin, INPUT);
      Serial.begin(9600);
      attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(interrupt_pin), step, RISING);
    }
    
    void step() 
    {
    	move_on = !move_on;
    }
                      
    void loop()
    {
      noInterrupts();
      
      digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
      Serial.println(""high"");
      
      interrupts();
      while(!move_on){delay(10);} //wait for clock
      step(); //reset for next step
      noInterrupts();
      
      digitalWrite(13, LOW);
      Serial.println(""low"");
      
      interrupts();
      while(!move_on){delay(10);} //wait for clock
      step();

arduino,"Attempting speed control of a stepper motor using timer interrupts, but the calculated speed keeps inverting. What am I missing?","I am trying to make a simple orbital shaker which uses an A4988 driver and a stepper motor to give a precisely-controlled speed. (I know things like this already exist, but I wanted the learning experience and for the motor to start and stop very gently).

Originally I tried a few non-blocking stepper motor libraries but the motor would still do a little ""pause"" whenever the Arduino calculated the current speed. It really seemed like the non-blocking driver libraries aren't non-blocking at all!

Some users on here helped me out by suggesting I ditch the libraries and use timer interrupts to set the speed instead, so I followed a few tutorials on how to do that and wrote some code which averaged out the last 10 inputs for target RPM, calculated the CMR ([compare match register](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Timer-Interrupts/)) required for that speed, and set the CMR to achieve that speed. I am very new to this so I'm not sure if this is the ""correct"" way of doing things.

The problem is the equation that calculates the CMR. The code includes some serial output for diagnostics, in which you can see the desired RPM, the frequency (in Hz) of the output signal, and the CMR required to achieve that frequency. The frequency and RPM come out correct, but the CMR arbitrarily goes into negative numbers and back to positive, like this: 

    rpm: 3
    freq: 20
    cmr: 780
    
    rpm: 4
    freq: 26
    cmr: 599
    
    rpm: 5
    freq: 32
    cmr: -489
    
    rpm: 6
    freq: 40
    cmr: -652
    
    rpm: 7
    freq: 46
    cmr: -869
    
    rpm: 8
    freq: 52
    cmr: -1303
    
    rpm: 9
    freq: 60
    cmr: -3907
    
    rpm: 10
    freq: 66
    cmr: 7811

I'm pretty sure I've made some simple math error somewhere, but I can't find it for the life of me and neither could my lab's resident engineer. [Here](https://pastebin.com/petCmYgG) is a link to my code - I would really appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction."

arduino,How to convert project from Arduino Uno to Arduino Pro Micro?,"Hi all, 

I am currently working on a personal project with the goal to create a MIDI expression controller for my music production. I have the code working on my prototype and am currently designing the PCB layout using EasyEDA.

&amp;#x200B;

[Current list of Components: Arduino Uno, 3x 75mm potentiometer faders, 1x 0.96\\"" OLED display, 1x Rotary Encoder](https://preview.redd.it/scp6glzx4f471.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0722f34a3783026be322ef590014256770ffe469)

I now realized that it would be cleaner to mount the Arduino directly to the PCB, which isn't possible with the UNO, so I want to, instead, use a tiny Arduino Pro Micro (which my father gave me) that I can mount directly to the PCB. That cleans up the design and doesn't require a bunch of ribbon cables that connect the components to the Arduino. 

With that, all said, I was not able to get my code to work on the Pro Micro. The Pro Micro is not available in the default board selection list, so I tried downloading some additional board libraries, but they didn't work either.  

(by the way, I think the Pro Micro that my dad gave me is a Chinese knock-off - just in case that has an impact on what is required to make it work)

Can anyone help me out here? 

Cheers,

The code works great, but when I leave the Kinect camera frame and come back, the led strips completely freeze up. If anyone could provide some insight or some ideas it'd be appreciated.
